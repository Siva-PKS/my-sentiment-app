134236,mobile,"I bought the phone on Amazon and been using my Samsung M30s for couple of weeks now. Delivery experience from Amazon - top notch. The best thing about the phone is its battery life. With normal usage, the battery works for days. With lots of gaming and app usage, it still easily works for 2 days. With 6000 mAH battery life is no problem at all. The 6.4"" super AMOLED display is awesome. The camera notch at top is minimum. Gives a very immersive experience while gaming or watching videos. With 8 core CPU, performance of gaming and other heavy apps is extremely good. The back camera is 48MP triple rear camera. What that means is you can snap photos normally and ultra-wide shots. The night mode is also good. Front camera is also good. No auto-focus for front camera. Optical image stabilisation is missing for both cameras. All in all, the camera is great in the price range. The pricing of the phone makes it a great buy. The build quality is similar to other Samsung phones. Very light weight and sleek phone. Only disadvantage I found is the speakers of this phone. No stereo support and the only speaker at the bottom is very low in volume. Verdict - With the given price range, the battery life, great camera and amazing display makes this phone a great buy !!"

157661,smartTv,"The iPhone 7 is legitimately among the most interesting, opinionated, powerful phones Apple has ever shipped, and the most confident expressions of the company's vision in a long time. New iOS 11 is excellent, the camera is much better, and the performance is phenomenal (stay away from Android users who say I have 4 - 6 - 8 - or - 100 GB of RAM, iPhone beats everyone in limited resources). Good Stuff - Water resistance - Improved cameras - Better battery life - Great display - Taptic engine feedback is neat Bad Stuff * Trust me these are advanced features that we are not used to if you are then these are Good stuff. - Lack of headphone jack is inconvenient - Wireless audio ecosystem is immature"

169807,mobile,"redmi 6A, budget smartphone, it is featured with decent camera and screen size, sound quality is good but speakers are at back side which sometimes interrupt your enjoyment while listening music without earphones, battery charges fast but drains also fast, may be it is due to its mediatek procerssor. overall for a light mobile user, it is a best option."

153098,mobile,Realme U1 is really an awesome product.This is a mid range phone in terms of performance.Lets have a look at its pros and cons Pros:- 1.Vivid display and water droplet notch. 2.Best screen to body ratio 3.MediaTek Helio P70 SoC performs lag free performance 4.The front 25-megapixel camera captures detailed selfies and rear camera is decent too. 5.Fludic face detection 6.Good audio quality 7.Value for money Cons:- 1.Color OS not so intutive and takes time getting used to even for experienced smartphone users 2.Battery performance 3500 mha though decent but 5000 mha has become segment norm. 3.Average low light camera performance 4.No 4k video recording and video stabilisation 5.Body and screen is fingerprint and smudge magnet Realme U1 is a really value for money product and I credit Amazon for providing me a nice deal on my purchase.I got 3270 for my nearly 18 months old Moto G5 plus and Amazon gave me additional discount of nearly 1600 inr on Amazons special sales day.I got 5156 INR as final cart value.Nearl 10 days have passed and I am satisfied with the overall performance of the phone considering the budget.

118439,smartTv,"Bought this at a great price during the prime day sale. Had the previous gen full hd fire stick which served me well on my previous smart TV. Bought this to check out the improvements and also to compare it with the native apps on WebOS on my TV. This literally blows away the native apps. Dolby vision, hdr10 works flawlessly. I had my doubts about the wifi since I'm pretty old school and always hardwire stuff. But the AC wifi on this works even better than the wired ethernet connection on my TV. The apps run great and super fast. Lastly and this is my opinion a huge huge win.. Plex. This stick actually plays 4K in plex without transcoding with absolutely no issues. That just sealed the deal for me. Granted you need a pretty beefy pc to do this and mine is, but even then the WebOS plex app used to glitch out every now and then. Tip : Keep the hdr on the stick to adaptive and tweak the dolby vision and hdr settings on your TV separately. Once you nail them right, there's no going back to native apps. Super Duper Impressed!!"

134346,mobile,"I bought this phone because of it's battery life , but display and performance of the phone is also very good with 4gb ram. Little disappointed with built quality. Cheap plastic used fit and finishs are fine. Upper body vibrates while using primary speaker at full volume because of plastic body. Display may broke if mobile falls from hand in normal conditions because of battery size and its weight. I would suggest to buy hard case for better safety instead of flexible silicone cases. At this price its good deal."

157849,smartTv,"The on board OS could have been better. Better tuned hardware could have avoided the long boot up time. Other than that, a good buy. Tripping on 60fps 4k's like no tomorrow. P.s. Should have had the option to install more streaming apps. Certain apps have been blocked from the play store. Eg. Prime."
158086,mobile accessories,The phone is great for the price. More so because of the additional discounts received during the sale.
138409,smartTv,"It is a OK product though works slow after 2 month, all features of remote don't work."

It is like manual which can help you to understand yourself better and better. It is a masterpiece one can say, but this book has confused me a lot. The book has lots of things one can implement, but it is not easy to change someone's perspective to see the life. Its useless if you just read some book for your knowledge and do nothing about it."

I charge my Nokia 7 Plus (3800 mAh) and still I can see 50-75% battery left and build of product is incredible, it feels so solid in hand and easy to carry. As well I charged my iPad pro 2017 fully using it. The fast charge output is so good it charges nearly same as the dash/ fast/turbo chargers that come with the phone. Overall thumbs up"

152247,smartTv,"Product was delivered in time. Excellent case provided by JBL in terms of packaging itself. Although expensive, the product quality and sound is too good. The sound doesn‚Äôt faulter at high volume. Bluetooth connectivity is very good too. The depth of the sound and bass is awesome compared to other similar products of various brands. Surround sound effect is also great!! Haven‚Äôt tasted the water resistant ability. Battery life is sincerely good. Mic for the phone isn‚Äôt good. This review is for this product which is almost a couple months old with me."

159848,mobile,"This is not a phone , it's a beast . Samsung calling it as monster, yes it's a monster -display quality is next to none in this price range ( none of the phones can come close to this ) , - Call quality ,signal reception is just great . - Earpiece is so loud and even at high volume you'll not find any distortion . -Battery life is stellar ( real monster) - Though it has 6k mah battery the weight distribution is great , it doesn't feel bulky . - One UI is so smooth it has plenty of features you can play around, you'll easily get used to the UI ( it's very simple & feature rich ) . - Camera under good lighting situations produces great pics , Dynamic range is good , colour saturation is great . -Low light/ artificial light camera is average. ( C+) - selfie camera under good lighting situations produces decent photos , struggle at low light. -Video stabilization is A+ just awesome - auto focus in video is a hit or miss - you can even play PUBG at high graphics with minimal frame drops , gaming also good If you want A+ display A+ battery life and low light camera is on your low priority then this is the phone for you. I'm in love with the phone ( low light camera is not the highest priority for me ) Watch the 1hour full review in YouTube Adithya Vlogs"
133949,mobile accessories,"I am using this phone since its launch. I would just say I LOVE THIS PHONE... Processor, RAM management, Camera, Battery, Display, etc. are all the best in class."
153693,mobile accessories,"Samsung M30s is a very good phone, Pros:- 1) Big battery 2) Sleek and premium design 3) Super Amoled display Cons:- 1) No Notification light. 2) Camera quality can be improved little bit. 3) Should give atleast 20-25W fast charging as battery is 6000mah despite it has 15w fast charging still it takes approx 2 hours 40 minutes from 0 to 100%. REST everything is nice will recommend can go for it for sure. Samsung design and one ui is also nice."
163635,smartTv,"Very good quality for 4K, UHD. Its looking Nice"
123238,mobile,Exlent
159563,mobile accessories,"This is a premium phone in this range as its build quality is excellent. The interface is so much easier and handy. The battery is also very impressive as It can last upto a day and a half . The fingerprint scanner and the face detection is also quite impressive in this segment, the response time is less than a second. There is no lag while playing games ,the screen quality is very good. The light sensor is very responsive also the camera quality is nice and given that the wide camera lens makes it much more interesting. Talking about the front camera it is also impressive as compared to the price tag of the phone . It also has fast charging and charges it at a rate of 1 to 2 percent per minute or slight less than a minute. The body is scratch less and the it comes with a single speaker but it is more than enough. The touch is very smooth and feathery. There are many additional features like increase touch sensitivity while using gloves and device manager. And nonetheless it comes with a brand value of Samsung providing nice service all around the globe and easy to locate the service centers anywhere in India or in any other country. So my recommendation is to go for it because in this range the Samsung has offered everything to make it a premium flagship ."
158153,mobile,"The phone is sleek and looks sexy! However the battery life is bad..... using apps and the phone continuously for sometime drains out the battery really quick, which is a huge draw back for a new phone! Secondly iOS 13 is taking up quite a lot of space therefore 32GB IPhone is just not recommended! Camera is just good! Overall not satisfied with 6S 32GB"

114421,mobile,"Awesome phone. Feels great in hand. Body feel, battery, on-screen display is excellent."
165580,mobile,"With it's 6000 mah battery m30s is an awesome purchase, in hand experience is really good and feels lightweight compared to the massive battery it has. Camera quality is really good and looks natural, ultra wide is love üòç Gaming experience on M30s is amazing and smooth, we can play heavy games easily without any lag. Game Booster is very helpful while gaming as we can block all the notifications and popups. M30s comes with every feature a person needs on his device(big battery, good performance, great camera, awesome design) with such attractive price. #GoMonster"

151311,mobile,"Please note that I am putting my pathatic review after using the phone for last 6 days. I don't know how gadget guru's make people fool with fake biased review. 1. Once purchase there is no refund if you don't like the product 2. The camera is pathetic. A bellow 10k phone is far better than 48mp triple camera pictures. In low lights not a single picture you will like to keep after taking snaps. 3. The speaker sound is not even clearly audio able in home itself, very low sound . You have to make pindrop sound silence to hear the sound. The micro phone does not picks up sound with a little distance. Please don't become a pray of marketing skills of Amazon for selling samsung mobiles."

159953,mobile,This is the best mobile provided by realme at this price range. The design and look of the phone is very good. The phone works excellent and battery life is superb. The charging speed of the phone is also good. The rear camera of the phone is also fine but the portrait mode of the phone is not that ok. It sometimes blur the edge of the object and the sharpness of the picture is not that great in the portrait mode. Although front camera is very good and takes very good selfies. At last the phone is very good choice at this price range and it is value for the money product.
139823,smartTv,It's is a masterpiece! The camera is just amazing and the improved display and water resistance makes the phone very sprcial. Would definitely recommend it if you can afford it. The better companion to this phone in a lower price segment is oneplus 3t

157871,mobile,The only reason behind purchasing this was the step counting. And to my utter disappointment it's pedometer is faulty. It counts the hand/wrist movement as steps. I am really sad that even after spending so much it did not serve my purpose. Please don't waste your money. Pacer app on mobile is far more accurate than this wasteful gadget.
159519,mobile,This is a good product. I like the mic quality very much. I can talk using this in a crowded place still the other person hear in a good quality voice.
136758,refrigerator,I recently bought this camera night mode pics are really coming blurr and shaky.pickels also not clear only in night mode.pls help me to find the right mode or replace this one because I think it's a problem.

I was advised by my fellow members to go for other phone which comes at the same price. But I decided to stick on Samsung. So without any hesitation I go for this M30 model. And I was not disappointed. Though I don't have any fascination on Mobile camera, Still like to say that it is awesome. I feel no one can beat Samsung on this part, except iPhone. Battery lasts for almost 1 and half day with my wifi on most of the times. Screen resolution is also awesome. In single word this is a excellent phone at this price. thank you Samsung."

I love the apps available on the app store and the watch faces are all awesome !!! I love that i can store music on it...i dont need to carry my phone for music while running anymore... Its GPS is almost perfect at par with Garmin !!! Its Heart rate monitor is good but not perfect... The swivelling bezel is what i love the most....it feels awesome to use the watch...

134050,mobile,I am writing this review after using it for more than one week. At this price point this phone is amazing. I should say battery is really a monster. Let me explain individual points : Display : It's super amoled. So no doubt display is 5/5. Camera : we have triple camera setup here. 48 mp gives good detail and wide angle lens also gives a good coverage. Performance of depth camera is also good. Front camera is performing good when u have good lighting. In low lighting if you are taking individual selfies then you have option of display flash and that gives a good. Performance : this mobile is performing really good in day to day usage. UI : less customization available. But easy to use that is good. Battery : that is a real MONSTER. I love small mobiles so it could have been a complete killer for me if screen size is less than 6 inches.
110619,smartTv,"A good buy. Satisfied. The only drawback is the charge, 3 hrs max backup."

153528,mobile accessories,"Right decision taken by Samsung to reduce the price by 1000‚Çπ within 15 days of its launched. Those who (including me) have purchased it with its original price feels cheated. But I still believe with its current price 7999 the phone is not worth as you can get much better options. So I will not be surprised if it makes another price cut within next 15 days. Now abt the phone , I only find the battery and the super amoled screen good, Rest the camera , cpu performance and signal strength not good. Finger print sensor is slow. For comparison the Redmi 7 gives better performance than this phone. I am sure with this price bracket there are much better options available in amazon itself."

135510,smartTv,"I have used every model of iPhone since 2007, and I bought both iPhone7 and iPhone7 Plus, so I think I can review this, but I am not going to. I think I don't need to review an iPhone! It is out of the world, no doubt about that, but I am here surprised because I actually got an email, asking me to give 1 star rating to iPhone7 on amazon.in, and in return, they'll send me some freebies! This is both terrible and concerning. Looking at the reviews now, it is quite evident that people in India are obviously believing this. EVERY 1/2/3 star review is fake, and it is really easy to spot one. - NONE of them have 'Verified Purchase' badge, infact as of now, I am the only one with this badge! - Most accounts were created on the same date to get the freebies. - Most have only 1 item review history. I hope they all are getting their free USB data cable. - There are bots that can create these fake amazon accounts with disposable email ID's. I have reported this issue to amazon, and I hope they are taking required actions."

139926,mobile accessories,It's not at all worth the money and the main reason is its wireless connectivity. Sounds keeps on distorting when you are in motion and your phone is in your pocket or at some distance and that's the main reason for using wireless headphones which this does not fulfils
129176,mobile,Good phone brought it during Diwali sales!
119318,mobile accessories,Camera quality is good but one thing huawai must done that processing of image must be improve. White balance and colur is more saturated and image seems unrealistic.
160558,mobile,This product is good but when if the problem arise there care centers are give you wrost experience even if your device is in warranty.
158049,mobile accessories,"The phone is getting slow day by day. The battery backup is not up to the mark. My realme2 had around 3200mah battery, but that used to last longer than m30's 5000mah battery. Finger print is slow at times. Camera is good. Overall i will not prefer and recommend samsung m30 or i guess any samsung phone due to its slowness and performance issues."
119933,mobile,"Coming from using Moto G5s+ I was hoping to have as easy handling of two SIMs, but I have ended up clicking more than less, maybe I have not found the correct option yet, but a good phone, value for money. I found the fingerprint sensor not as sensitive, have to press at times. Battery last two days for my usage. I miss cameras that show life as it is without processing, processing should ideally be done afterwards not on the original"

Don't buy iPhone unless you are living in United States since iPhone customer service their after sales suck in India. I purchased this XR for the initial price of 76600, I went on a trip and some water spilled the phone stopped working, the screen went blank. I took it to the service center and they say by looking at the screw of the phone that someone already tried to open the screw and it won't be covered under warranty and they were not even willing to open the phone and check...so my 70k product is lying at home with me still paying my emi's. It was the greatest mistake I have done and I have learnt my lesson and I don't want people to suffer like me. I have not much complaints on the product quality. But what is more important is that after sales service of the product. So I urge everyone not to waste money on this product. You get phones with better features than iPhone and at cheaper price. Be smart."

At first, Thank you Amazon for such a wonderful product and Best offer to ever loving customers with discount from various banks. My basic need was a phone that can support 2 JIO SIM's at once. For my un-fortunate belief, every website shown phone which were costing not less than 10k. Redmi 6A, RedMI Rocks again !!! Once again, one of the best product from Redmi for optimal price with excellent features. Pros: Support 2 JIO sims at once. Dual sim jio lovers certainly cant miss this phone. Slim, light weight and enough handy. Performance and Speed wise, its a good call Camera, Sound and Seemless transition is good Security options plenty. Voice quality is good Cons : Average battery. No finger print. Overall, It served my need of 2 JIO sims for which, I am so happy about this product. Thank you Redmi... Keep rocking !!!"

133218,mobile accessories,Hi Sharing review after having tough times with this phone. I bought this product though within a week experienced heating problem and suddenly phine gets off. I had asked amazon care for an exchange and after having a strong discussuion of nearly 1 hour convinced to replace this product on its last day of exachange. After having an exchange product color was not the same what i had ordered in my first order still thought not to have another argument for it. The replaced product is working fine without having heating problem or anything though not heavy used like gaming.. this leads me might earlier one was a faulty product. I would not highly recommend this even my whole family is having samsung :) you can go for A50 which would be the better one than this Overall phone is decent to use only if you're not installing heavy applications or games.
114069,smartTv,Awesome experience I'm very happy with my purchase everything is good
156919,mobile,The Phone was damaged. Small scratches on the sides. Never expected this would happen with the brand new phone.

Display & screen resolution is pretty good ,really loved it. Performance is good and very soothing. Battery doesn't run out easily & easy to charge, it charges upto 25 percent within 30 minutes & takes 2 ¬Ω hours for full charge. Con's:- Back panel looks kinda good but as it is plastic it is easy to get damaged & not at all scratch resistant . They didn't provided back case & headset. Its durability is poor . OVERALL THE BEST PHONE AT THIS PRICE RANGE..."

170080,mobile,the phone doesn't live upto its expectations as per the specs. processor speed is very disappointing. camera is pretty average. below average phone...
154804,smartTv,Sound bass is really good but USB music should be upgraded where it will be more convenient than playing Bluetooth through mobile phone.
150514,mobile,Phone is good but battery draining too fast Heating issue is major drawback. But after 15 days of use I think it is the best phone in this range. Heating issues are almost in control.

136586,smartTv,"I purchased this laptop from eZone and not from any E-retail sites like Amazon and Flipkart. I have been using it since 2 months now. PROS : 1. Looks are good. Build quality is good. 2. Sound is good. 3. Battery backup is nice too. 4. Full HD at 30,000 bucks is good. 5. Windows 10 original 6. Good for multimedia purpose usage. CONS : 1. Due to factory installed Windows 10, it is slow after booting. Disk usage is high. So for programming purpose, you either format and install Windows 7 / 8.1 or upgrade your RAM to 8 GB."

Pros: =>Good sound quality,a very good bass, =>good battery backup(really it plays upto 45mins with10mins charging) =>Fits perfectly to my ears(various sizes of extra buds added) =>light weight cons: No cons for sound quality,but i feel that Wires are bit lengthy(but i compromised for bass and sound quality) Finally kudukara kaasuku worthu!!"

Portrait mode is working fine with perfect edge detection. PUBG freaks you can play in fully max video setting without any lag at all. Though the packaging was terrible only one plastic wrap was there, expected to be inside a box ."
165984,refrigerator,"Worst Fitbit band!! It counts steps when I am asleep. When you are on bike, steps are counted again. Move your hands, it counts. For the same range you will get gear S3 which is much more efficient if you can live with it by charging every 2 days. I have requested for replacement and the replacement device is in customs for last 2 weeks and Fitbit doesnt do anything about this. Your country your headache!!! Buy Mi band or honor bands which got service centers which are also offered at lesser pricing"

154099,mobile,Serious network issue. Don't think of purchasing it if your area have moderate signal quality as shown on other phones. The phone is having problem in video call using the default dialler app. Coins Network reception power too low to work. Camera have actually 12 megapixel sensor. I have tested it with multiple app downloaded from play store. Pro Good battery backup. The Samsung UI don't have ads. The 12 megapixel camera show good performance in low light condition. Purchase the phone only if your area has very very good network coverage. Otherwise you have to use the phone over Wi-Fi only.

Samsung being a big player, don't know why they play such cheap tricks by saying camera is 48MP on paper and fooling people by providing a low quality camera in actual. This phone should have been priced under 10K. Not worth of 14K."

139038,smartTv,"It was a great experience having a Lenovo laptop as my first pc. Good product, classic, as I would describe it."
160063,smartTv,"This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc. Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo. For example when you say- 1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer. 2) continue with next query like how to reach there ? Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do.. This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there. Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you. Amazon music has very limited music base. So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans."

153877,smartTv,"Satisfied with the product! Screen display is absolutely brilliant, better than any other phone currently in the market along with stereo speakers that give an excellent experience if you tend to watch videos or listen to songs using the speakers. Since I upgraded from an iPhone 6, I found the speed to be slightly but noticeably faster. Battery backup is the normal duration what you'd expect from an iPhone about a day with the wifi or 4G switched on. Only problem I found was a bit of a heating problem which only happened a few times."

Even i use my phone so roughly on daily basis like a rough user of cellphone but the screen is still fine and did not got any any scratches over it. The time i have bought M-20 that was the time i have fallen for with my phone. Samsung is doing so great work for millennials."

136728,mobile accessories,"I received the phone about two weeks back and immediately noticed that it gives out a mild electric shock while charging the phone. Not only that but even with very light use, the phone overheats. Looks like Apple chose to lower their standards to keep their high margins while selling for Indian customers and hence the lower price. I might have received a lemon but I highly doubt it."

Fingerprint reader is not upto the notch,it sometimes didn't just let you in and you have to enter password. All is good but the problem is that this started to cause issues in just 1.5 years,,it automatically just switch off without any issue which is quite frustrating.IDK why android phones are not long lasting. All comes with the age limit cap of 2 years i guess so you have to buy again."

160265,mobile,This phone has some serious network issues. The same SIM when put into some other phone shows 80 to 100% network but in this phone it shows 50 to 60%. Call drops and voice stuck ups over a call are quite frequent. Rest all features are top notch but it is very unlike samsung to undermine such a basic phone feature. I've not used any cover and tried every setting I could but still this issue exists. I hope samsung fixes this through some software patch.

116326,mobile,"Been using this device for last 4 days & made following observations: * Battery is a beast. U will never run out of charge wid dis device. * Screen is treat to look at. Watching videos is first class experience. * No heating or lag observed in what ever little gaming I did. * Build quality is nice. * Gud ram mgmt. * Android 1 is buttery smooth. Minimal app overhead which can b easily uninstalled. * Charging is not superfast but wid given bettery size I would say it's pretty fast. * Fingerprint & face unlock both working gr8. * Call quality & signal reception both good. Also wifi connection working properly. D only con I observed in dis brief tenure is der is no way to put data rate displaying at the status bar. All & all a gud buy at dis price point. If u are not a gamer & want a reliable handset for everyday use, I'll definitely recommend dis phone to you."

160433,smartTv,"This phone rocks..apple Totally nailed it... earlier I was using realme 3 pro ..than I decided to buy iPhone 11 pro ..at first I was hesitant to buy it because of it's price. But than my uncle suggested me to sell kidneys,if I wanted to buy this . I had to sell both kidneys because one was not enough . Never regretted my decision , such a value for money , whatever u want to do -play games, watch movies etc this phone is best .There is one problem though , uncle is no more üò•"

142559,mobile accessories,Major issue is earphone not supported in note 5 pro. I tried installed blancco smart check app as per the Amazon policy to return this phone but it showed results as working fine even if earphone is not supported. Now I see customers support is currently unavailable and unable to return this phone.
127939,mobile accessories,Good budget phone

132730,smartTv,"HI, I am writing this review after using it for a month for doing development on Visual Studio. The laptop performance is pathetic. I decided to do a RAM upgrade. I thought while buying, looking at Amazon's product specs (pls see the picture) which said there are two RAM slots and hence I can do an upgrade to 12 GB. But when I spoke to HP Technical support, they were not sure. They asked me to check if it has two RAM slots. The Gadgets now page states that it has only one RAM slot. (please see the picture). So buyers, pls check with Amazon or HP before buying. I will come to know the status after I take it to HP's authorised service agent. Updates on 18th Sep. Hi, I would like to update for the benefit of those who had read my earlier review. I managed to speak to HP and got a confirmation that the laptop does have two RAM slots. I have bought an additional 8 GB RAM card and have installed the same on this laptop and the laptop is working fine. So now I have two RAM slots - one with a 4 GB Ram card and another with 8 GB Ram card. The laptop shows 12 GB RAM and I am seeing a marked improvement in performance."
124299,smartTv,"Flip 4 is decent sound with base, works well for my requirement, sound is clear crisp and looks very classy, but it is not very loud, any one want high volumes can go for JBL charge 3, sound quality is very good, battery looks Okay, i tried playing it continuous for 5hrs. Worth for this price . JBL has gain trust of millions. Not tried any test for waterproof. Once again its not very loud but it is very very clear and crisp with okay bass."
119510,mobile accessories,Camera quality very poor as mentioned 48 MP.
110384,mobile accessories,"48 mp main camera and 8 mp wide angle camera are awsmm,speechless..as my view, it is one of the most fabulous smartphone in MI product designed by xiaomi for its most special feature ""ANDROID ONE"" with GOOGLE which will be soon updated by android 10(Q)..screen is also good as it is amoled..Fingerprint sensor and faceunlock are also beautiful.."
141522,mobile,Let's come direct to the point....... Pro's 1. A big massive battery lasts easily 2 days 2. Super amoled screen 3. Performance Cons 1. Plastic build 2. Doesn't have a gorilla glass 3. Some times for a minute or two the phone gets slightly heated on the upper part when you download any file . I think these 3 pro's and cons will help you ....just go and grab in price segment 13k

110040,smartTv,"#This is a review after fairly one week of use This Laptop is really very good. It has one of the best features that an ideal budget gaming laptop should have. It has a 1TB SSHD(You can consider it to be a storage system which lies between a normal HDD and an SSD), which is really very fast, alongwith a 128GB SSD, which makes the system even more faster. This is the reason why it takes not more than 15 seconds to boot up! This is really incredible! It is powered by Intel core i5 - 8300H, which is better than Intel Core i7 - 8550U! Talking about its Graphics Processor, It has an NVIDIA GTX 1050 with 4GB VRAM, which is ideal considering its price. I've played a couple of games, CS:GO and Apex Legends. Both the games have really eye-catching graphics. The laptop has no problem at all in running both the games. The FPS count in both the games were within 50 - 60(for CS:GO) and 40 - 70(for Apex Legends) which is mind - blowing at this price! (FPS drops when the charger is not plugged in). Talking about its cooling, it just takes the prize over that, as its cooling is one of the best, not between the budget segment, but also between the expensive or flagship gaming laptops. The track-pad is big enough for daily use(The gestures are very useful). The keyboard is also amazing! The flow and the responsiveness or feedback given by the keyboard is just wonderful. With the red - backlit keyboard(With 3 levels of brightness), the keyboard looks fabulous. The screen is also very good. It is a FHD IPS - level display, with crunchy colours. All the necessary ports are available on the laptop except Type - C port, which is a negative point I found on the laptop. Also there is one con, the screen is fairly big, it is 15. 6 inch, but the bezels around the screen are big. This is a point of personal preference where some might like bezel - less screens, whereas some may like screens with big bezels. The webcam fitted in the laptop is very bad, as expected, which should not be a problem for most of the people. One thing which I liked about the laptop is that the stereo speakers present in the laptop is very loud, which is surprisingly very good, as this is the problem of most of the laptops, where the speakers remain the weak - point of many expensive laptops, being a powerhouse. But this is not the case with this laptop. The speakers are really good in this laptop. Lastly, my final verdict is - YES! THIS IS DEFINITELY A LAPTOP WORTH BUYING. This is really a very good deal at this price point."
115151,mobile,Bad product after 6 month product was death
153284,mobile accessories,Received yesterday Battery Backup is awesome Camera is also good considering its price A perfect ergonomically designed phone.
166043,smartTv,Worst decision ever to buy this laptop. Its very heavy and its looks are not same as it is shown in the pictures.
151975,smartTv,"Product is good, but there is no autoplay option.everytime you have to go to input menu and select AV to see the channels. This will problem to illetarate people. I wish this problem will resolved in next android update.......Good product....I heartily suggest this product"

139903,mobile,"It's nice phone after using for more than 6 month can say.. battery life is good, camera is somehow ok.. But overall phone is good package"
133033,mobile accessories,Healpful
153948,mobile accessories,"Screen is not FHD hence video watching experience is not so good, rest other is good , finger print scanner is bit slower"
124550,smartTv,Front camera is awesome but batter discharge very fast
163610,smartTv,Very good project
140726,mobile,Its slim light weighted and amazing camera quality. Battery back up is excellent. Purchased at excellent deal price. Thanks amazon.
124209,mobile,"First off, the battery life is INCREDIBLE! This is the first phone I have used where I can get two days of use on one charge! I would regularly charge the phone overnight one night, then go to bed at midnight with 55-60% left the next night, leave it unplugged, and finish the next day at midnight with around 2-5%. The size of the phone was just just about perfect for holding/scrolling with one hand, and I usually wear men‚Äôs size medium gloves for reference. The notch didn't bother me when using the phone for basic functions, but was annoying when watching videos; and I was a lot of videos on my phone, so that was kinda a deal breaker. It‚Äôs not that the notch bothered me by covering content, but rather the aspect ratio was based off the bottom of the notch instead of the top of the screen, so 18:9 aspect ratio videos either always had gaps around the notch, or they were cut off when zoomed to fit; 16:9 videos obviously didn‚Äôt fill the screen nicely either and made for a viewing experience closely resembling that of the older small iPhones. I also didn‚Äôt like the 18:9 aspect ratio in general as most videos I watch are still in the more common 16x9 aspect ratio. Face ID was very cool when logging into apps and websites that use password, but it wasn‚Äôt very consistent when unlocking the phone in the mornings (when half my face was shoved into a pillow and I looked like hell), when the phone was oriented sideways, or when the phone was lying on the table; ultimately, I reverted to turning off the security entirely. At that point, the notch became even more of an annoyance, since I wasn‚Äôt using Face ID; however, I did not use Touch ID on older iPhones either. With that being said, I do like Face ID better than Touch ID of previous iPhones. Another downside to the iPhone XR is the resolution. While the screen is indeed VERY nice to look at, the resolution was less that I would prefer. I would not have noticed the lower resolution of the screen if I had not been comparing it next to the iPhone 8 Plus. The problem is not with the screen itself, but that some apps had downsampled the display to 720p, instead of 1080p, which was very noticeable. I would say the iPhone XR screen is better looking than the iPhone 8 Plus in terms of producing deeper blacks and slightly better colors, and the lower resolution isn‚Äôt noticeable except for some apps as previously mentioned. Overall, the iPhone XR is and awesome but, and I recommend it, but I ended up returning it for the iPhone 8 Plus simply for the wider screen with 16:9 aspect ratio, and higher resolution. Thanx to amazon for the speedy delivery and price"
140414,mobile accessories,"Its all fine but very slim, phone width is very less but yes it looks like iphone (Width Size and overall look). If someone likes a wider phone then I won't suggest/recommend it."
126604,mobile,Good
168893,smartTv,"its been almost 4 hours I am using this Laptop and trust me I am loving every bit of it, its handy, looks cool, sleek, its beautiful, its light yet super fast. battery charges quick tons of good things, 256GB SSD and 8 GB of RAM are the main highlights the only thing that could have been better is the screen but then its under 30000 so not a big deal HD+ display is still good enough. thumbs up and thank you HP, thank you Amazon."

140656,mobile,"Its not even one month am using this product and it has already started showing up problem...the power bank itself is not charging....even if i keep it whole night for charging, it gets charged by only two bars"

More power, a lightning-fast processor, support for 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and a new antenna design, Fire TV Stick 4K allows you to enjoy a more complete 4K Ultra HD streaming experience. You can download various android applications and stream (Hotstar, Netflix etc. apps but subject to subscription)"

Firstly the enormous length gains that you get from your boring usb cable are pretty impressive, but then comes the durability, well to say the least it's as strong as a rope.

120232,mobile accessories,Dear Viewers I am written this review after usage f 15 days of this phone. Pros: Superb phone with monster battery life. Display is good. Cons: OTG is not supported in this phone. Camera is not like 48 megapixel. Charging cable is very short and back cover is also not provided in box. Back side of phone is simple and plastic not giving rich feel in this price segment. OS is ok Finger print sensor is ok not much faster as redmi. So the conclusion is not looking for battery life. Other things are also important.
115029,mobile accessories,Back camera is dislike processor is good

132656,smartTv,Gud phone with gud battery backup

Not even 24 hrs, it is lasting it's even earlier,,,, Apart from battery all other features like operating system, storage, camera, heating everything is good..."
154497,smartTv,"So I have been using android since long and thought that this is the right time to switch to iOS So I bought iphone7 jet black back in November 2016 and it's still working great for me. PROS 1)Faster than the previous IPhones 2)Camera quality is really good. Over the last couple of years, I have clicked a lot of photos. 3)Home button feels good and you can customize it according to your own comfort 4)Battery Backup is decent enough. Cons 1) Jet black scratches easily 2) Can't charge when using the provided earphones even though I generally prefer my Bluetooth earphones. 3) Limited connectivity to smartwatches apart from apple watch. I use a Gear S3 and there are some features that you can't use with iOS."
137530,mobile,"If u are buying this phone only for camera, then plz don't. Specifically the rear camera is very bad, picture quality is like VGA camera. Front camera is somehow manageble. Apart from that the phone is lag free with good battery life."

158000,mobile,"The phone is all gud. Camera is a beast amongst all other phones in this price range. There r only 2 cons abt this device, battery lyf is short, can stand hardly for a day and the screen has no notch or waterdrop! All other is absolutely fine with this device. Happy with my purchase!"
161555,smartTv,"Using iPhone 7 from last 9 months and my experience is amazing either in terms of user interface or camera or sound or the most important it‚Äôs speed. Even 4 or 6 gb of android may not have processing as fast as iPhone. Battery life is also good but the only drawback is it‚Äôs heating a little bit if I use it in temperature that go beyond the recommended range for its surrounding temperature. Rest everything is good. If you want to buy iPhone 7 in 2018, it‚Äôs worth buying."

124649,refrigerator,Fully satisfied with the product and looks so stylish in the kitchen as well
168447,books,gud
134154,smartTv,I bought it as an upgrade for iPhone 5S and it's been dismal purchase. In about 2 years time its battery has gone for a toss especially after moderate usage of internet (not more than 3:30 hours). 5S is still better than this. Apple might have reduced the price from 44k to 29k but it's still not worth it. Once a great fan of Apple I see now no point to use its phone as it seems to have intentionally slowed down the phone and done something to kill the battery.
140680,mobile accessories,Its okk okk Like fringe print is fyn but battery life is not that much good But fast changing so very good mobile in this range
125531,mobile,Good
141226,mobile,Just like bash I am totally satisfied with the phone and service

152454,mobile accessories,"Pros: Nice battery Backup, Excellent Looks, In Budget, Not heavy, Made In India, Good speed and performance. Cons: Phone voice call quality is not upto the mark. Does not have IR blaster so cannot use as a remote control. You can go with this one. It's worth in this price range when one wants to avoid cheap quality and short term companies."
153147,mobile,Rear camera should have beem better otherwise the phone is perfect in this price range
128170,mobile accessories,"Good device for everyday use. We are not gamers so can't comment on that, camera is average. Rest is fine. It does the job pretty well. For 14k it's good Neagtives - camera, plastic body"

Mi still doesn‚Äôt bother about its phones after multiple users reported same issue. Second phone arrived from West Bengal. Silicon case has no camera protection. First phone was from Bangalore. It had a protection for camera."
134391,mobile,"I bought this product 6 months ago. This product is working completely fine. The USB cable is not working but power bank performance is very outstanding. It can charge 3-4 times for an average android battery (3000mAh). Build quality is nice and light weight. To fully charge this power bank it takes about 6-7 hours with 2A charger. If you have more than 3500mAh android battery then I'll recommend to buy the 20,000mAh power bank as it will charge your phone more number of times than this 10,000mAh bank. I've been using it very properly and also bought cover for this power bank which makes it shock proof. I've provided the link below to buy cover for this. The provided link is for 20,000mAh bank cover but it perfectly fits for 10,000mAh battery also."
127704,mobile accessories,Good battery .but doesn't look like 5000 mah. Fast charging and good camera. Low light camera could have been better. Got first mobile replaced due to battery draining issue after long struggle with amazon customer care. Took almost 1 week for replacement very tiring.

Performance, display, storage & battery are the best. Mobile is little heavy in terms of weight.. Overall, In terms of internal features (Ram, storage, battery) with low price go for M series. But In terms of features + premium hardware quality (lookwise) go for A series. I had a bad delivery experience this time with Amazon. Very late delivery."

Phone hang: after using for hours you'll see this phone getting hang. Charging: At first , you'll see fast charging but after some weeks, there's no such thing as fast charging. Infact I left the phone charging from 1:30 PM(27%) before exam but after I came from exam it was charged to only 61% at 3:20 pm (approximately but not less than 3:20 pm). So it took around 2 hours to charge to 34% and it's really disappointing for gamers like us.(Btw I'm writing this review just because of disappointment: the tempered glass and the back cover as well) . People don't really sell the product like they show from the Amazon pic."

139382,mobile accessories,It's a poor product with too much hype. Camera claims to be 48 MP but image quality does not match even 8 MP quality. Plastic back body which gives it a cheap product look more prominent in white color. My regret purchase. Do not fall in love with the specifications given. Regretting big time and moreover Amazon will not exchange the product. Many times these platform acts as a medium to distribute cheap product due to higher profit margins for them. Many phone such as Redmi Note 7 are much better phone at lower price

As, i have compared no one in competition is offering this. Lowlight with f1.9 and Live focus for Bokeh mode is handled very well. Both M20 & M10 offer the same rear dual camera Selfie Camera:The M20 has a front shooter of 8MP with Selfie focus and the results for the same very good. There is no over saturation and natural M10: Also comes with a great 5MP and f2.2 aperture with selfie the rear camera on both devices has Pro mode, stickers, auto focus, live focus, Panorama, beauty mode besides wide angle mode to capture 120 degree field of view compared to the front camera in both devices has live focus, stickers and selfie mode as well."

124338,mobile accessories,"For a Samsung device this is as good as it gets for the price this Phone is being offered at. Pros: Super Amoled Display with Full HD resolution, Humongous battery, Decent Processor, Above average camera, master the Pro mode for better shots, Widevine L1 suport Cons: Plastic built, feels cheap in hand, especially the finger print sensor feels hollow while tapping, Slow charging speeds, 15 watts is not very fast and much cheaper devices like note 7s and vivo u1 have 18 watt charging support, takes a good two and a half hour to charge No notification LED, Always on display slightly makes up for it, No ambient light sensor, uses front camera to adjust screen brightness which is slow. No Gorilla glass, tempered glass would be necessary All in all a great device for its price but with some compromises that aren't a deal breaker for most of the people."

Built quality excellent 10/10 Screen is ok ok 8/10 Sound quality is nice 9/10 But doesn't have headphone jack thats why audio quality decrease while using third party headphones. Charging time is very nice. Charge 0 to 100 within 1 hour. But discharging speed is also very nice. Battery drain very quickly. I charge this device 2 to 3 times a day. If i use normal like only 4G internet. No gaming, no movies then i have to charge it twice a day or if plag pubg then i have to charge 3 times a day for 2 hour pubg play."

136453,mobile,"I ordered this phone on Diwali offer. The phone which I got first had display issue , so I got replacement for that.my previous phone was iPhone 6 Plus. After one week of using this phone, these are my honest review. Firstly the phone has excellent battery life . For average use, the battery lasts more than a day easily. Although charging takes time ie about 2 to 3 hours from 10% to 100%. As I am used to iPhone home button, I‚Äôm feeling a bit uncomfortable with this phone as it has no home button. You have to swipe up every time from bottom to top to unlock the phone. It has no finger print sensor . So it‚Äôs a bit difficult to unlock while ur in bed as u have to put ur face in front of the phone for FACE ID. Reach ability is an issue if u use one handed. Especially while using Facebook, when u have to swipe down from bottom line to make ur finger reach the top screen clicking options. Display of the screen is a bit below iPhone 6 Plus. So all in all the phone is just about satisfactory."

136888,smartTv,I think the product is just fine but the sound quality and touch pad are pathetic. It seems their is a problem of Touch pad in all LENOVO Laptops my old laptop was also lenove but different configuration it has the same problem touch pad quality and function is not good. I was expecting great sound quality but it turned out to be very poor. The battery back up is also not more than 3 hrs i was expecting it to be 5 atleast. Before zeroing on Lenovo I also checked acer laptop with almost the same configuration however fianalized lenovo due to its strong brand presence and sturdy products.

157841,mobile,The new samsung m30s is a pretty good mid range handset.The design looks very premium with a good color combination for the back.The 6.4 inch superamoled screen looks fantastic.The device comes with a notch display.The processor exynos 9611 is a new addition to the exynos fam and gives a balanced comb of power and performance. The device runs on android 9 with Samsung ui on the surface .The phone packs a triple rear camera setup with a 48mp primary and 8 mp wide angle plus 5mp depth cameras.Front camera is also a very good 16mp camera.The phone has a fingerprint scanner at the back and has face ai unlock feature as well.The picture quality of the camera is pretty decent comparing to the price of the smartphone. Low light photography is also well.Talking about the BIG 6000mah battery which gives 20 -24 hrs backup continuously is amazing. The charging time is also quite low as it has fast charging tech .Overall if your budget is somewhere around 15000 this phone is truly build for you .

124198,mobile,"First of all, kudos to Samsung for designing such an amazing phone at a cheap price. This phone is indeed an all rounder in all aspects. Let me sum up my review with the pros and cons... Pros: 1. Super Amoled screen: Amazing Display quality and viewing angles. Just loved the display provided by Samsung. Very immersive experience. If media consumption is your top priority then this phone will not depress you. 2. Monster 6000mah battery: Indeed this phone lasted me for more than 2 days with light usage scenarios. Overall great battery backup. Also there's 15W fast charger in the box so that's an added advantage in charging speed. 3. Performance: With exynos 9611 inside, the performance was pretty solid (like a monster). Multitasking and ram management was also a breeze. Playing high graphic games like pubg would be easily playable under high settings. 4. Camera: It houses a triple camera setup to the back. One 48MP shooter, one 8MP wide angle shooter and one 2MP depth sensor. The front camera is a 16MP shooter. Overall it shoots some great looking photos with good detail and sharpness. Now, however this phone excels in every aspect, there are still some minor cons present with the device which i want to share. 1. Camera: Although the camera quality is pretty great but still the quality of the image is not as expected. Specially the 48MP shooter shoots pictures which are not that detailed as compared with other competition. Also the front camera is little poor in capturing good lighting and detail of the subject under certain scenarios. However there's nothing much complain about the cameras and for this price it is still killer. Hence, my final verdict. If ur budget is strictly under 14k and you want great battery backup and performance then surely go for this phone, you will not be mistaken. However if your budget is little higher and camera is your main priority then I suggest you go for other competition which offer much better value for money. As for me, i am extremely in love with this phone. Thank you Samsung"

160041,mobile,"This is the worst phone I've ever seen. Battery is completely useless,8 out of 10 times the touch doesn't work , useless features"
110372,mobile,4 things are really important to me in a budget smartphone.. 1)good processor for gaming 2)big and good quality display 3) battery life 4) avg camera While buying this smartphone I was sure about all these things except the battery.... But now after using it for 3 months I will say that the battery life is very good considering that it has 3500mah battery on paper.. It will give you about 1day of battery with heavy usage (7 - 7:30 hours of SOT) and about 1.5 day on moderate usage (6 - 7 hours of SOT)

153250,smartTv,Received product within 3 days. LG technician came for installation found faulty card reader. He gave fault report on A4 page by scribbling down few words. Then put request through to give fault detail formally on company letterhead instead like a layman. Ordering is quick but replacement service is very poor. More of mucking around going not professional.

158393,mobile,"The product is amazing, I was looking for a mobile with large battery and wanted to go with a handset with 5000mah battery, but when this beast was launching with 6000mah, I waited for this as it had a better screen sampled, better processor and great value for money, this has given all competitors a very healthy competition. I have 6GB 128gb version, wanted to opt for realme XT but have chosen this for battery..... also got good discounts. Have not given 5stars as Samsung could have included a back cover with this but they wanted to save a few bucks here which is very disappointing."

169780,mobile accessories,really loved the product . the features are really impressive at this price range . got it for 11.5k only. only thing which was dissapointing was its camera. as the sensor is of samsung so the 48 MP doesnt performs well. its like 12MP only . the quality gets distorted when the image is zoomed . so not a good choice for camera lovers

137127,mobile,"I was skeptic before buying this mobile as reviews are not satisfactory, especially battery. But believe me, this phone is underrated. This phone deserves better rating than this. Coming to battery life, I'm not gamer, i always sleep with 40% charge. So.... For my usage, juice will stay for 1¬Ω day. Camera is beast. Everyone told in forums that, it's better to go for note 5 pro instead of A2. They are wrong, A2 is better than n5 pro. Except battery life, 5* for everything. 4000mah will be killer."

159005,mobile accessories,"There is little that I can say here about this beauty! The iPhone 6s is currently the best budget iPhone that you can get your hands on. It's been 4 days since I've been using this and I've only charged it twice. I use a good amount of internet for emails and research. The camera is just pure fun. It's feature packed and does the job better than most of the other counterparts out there. Switching from Andriod. I had my doubts. But the iOS is just a sheer pleasure to use. It's so simple yet incredibly effective! It's intuitive and makes your life really easy while working with the phone. For the price it is available right now, this is a must buy if you are considering buying a phone. Will post more updates when I've used it longer! And last but not the least... Thank you Amazon for the prompt delivery. Received the item one day before the estimated date! Simply brilliant!"
152871,smartTv,"Really a value for money product. I had to buy this after my age old CRT tv broke down beyond repairs. Got only 500 for it under exchange. The only problem I faced in first 3 months was the issue in connecting to home wifi, it used to take many minutes & multiple attempts to get it connected to wifi. But after a software update in January 2019, it started working well & now connects to home wifi quickly. The picture quality is quite good, looking at the price point of about 12k, bought it in Oct 2018. It connects & remains paired with my JBL Flip 3 bluetooth speaker easily. Streaming from my Samsung, Redmi & Lenovo mobiles is also easy over wifi. Voice recognition also works well. Very limited number of apps are enabled for android TV, however, you can also install additional apps using APK files from USB. Ok for browsing the Internet - had to download Puffin Browser. It takes sometime to get used to the quite hard remote buttons. Remote is very slim & sleek. As the remote is Bluetooth enabled, no need to point it directly to TV. I wish there was a direct setting to open/start the DTH/Cable input by default, as it is quite difficult to operate for elders in the family, as they don't know the remote navigation functions. I read someone complaining about not being able to install and run apps like Amazon Prime & Netflix on this TV. Please note that it is Amazon & Netflix's decision to not support this Android TV. Hence don't blame Xiaomi for this issue. It is due to the corporate fight between Google vs Amazon & Netflix. And has nothing to do with the capabilities of this TV."
161165,mobile,"Touch stopped working after 1 month, service center denied for replacement, asking for money, Never buy Mi , you will regret later"
153347,mobile,Redmi 6 pro is very nice product iam very happy with him

150663,mobile,Phone is overall working good as per my expectation. its worth buying this product
131675,smartTv,Great Buy. Great nice picture quality.App is very user friendly. All the features can be accessed with all buttons on remote. Picture quality of you tube 4k and Full HD videos are great.All Full HD videos are great yo watch with so much details. I found it great buy. The only cons is that some of the connections are on the rear side and difficult to connect if once wall mounting is done.It would have been best if those would have been on the side.But considering all 4K smart TV features it is great Buy
155377,smartTv,Suboodh
134967,refrigerator,I got this product for my friend as a gift and it won't charge ..... Worst buy from Amazon till date....it's embarrassing to gift someone something that's damaged Would suggest don't buy it from Amazon and go for the Mi online store cause the deal directly from the manufacturer
139616,mobile,"It's been just less than a year I bought iPhone 6s model, and the device failed to switch on now. I surrendered the product for service under warranty. But they are saying, cannot provide warranty service because there is a small crack on the rear camera lens cover but the camera was functioning well and that happened so many months back. Now, I feel like durability and service of this product is verse than any other mobiles on the market."
139338,smartTv,"It's a let down, I purchased shinco based on internet review's. But it lacks lots of basic features. Cons. It does not support voice search. It does not support play store. It hangs when I play 4k content via YouTube, only way to restore is power cycle. It's display adjustment settings are poor. Brightness Not comfortable to eyes. (Cannot adjust display settings when in smart mode) Tried for refund within given 10 day timeline, but Amazon cheaters denied. Henceforth will keep away from Amazon. Guys do not waste your hard earned money on Amazon, buy via store/ showroom etc. First have look at its features yourself then only buy."
128354,mobile,Good hand set Camera too good Battery life also good Fingerprint excellent
158209,mobile accessories,"The phone performance is so so. I have purchased 128gb with 6 gb model. A piece of advice, this handset is not able to support Pubg and it lags most of the times. Other than that if you do not want to do gaming it is fine. Better go for redmi note 7 pro instead."
136915,mobile,"I thought over a lot before buying considering the steep price. I moved from android to iOS with this phone. And, man... it was a great decision. I love every aspect of it. It is one of the neatest and smoothest phone I've ever used. If you're trying to make a decision and if you can afford it, I'd say just go for it. You wont regret."

136610,mobile accessories,"I purchased this phone on the day of its sale, when there were no reviews available. I made a big mistake in trusting the brand ""Samsung"" blindly. This phone might have pros but they are nothing special. Many smaller brands also provide those features. The one particular flaw that annoyed me the most and made me write this harsh review is lack of notification LED light. This may sound simple but what it means if your phones battery is low you won't notice any warning. If you are charging your phone you don't know if its charging because there is no LED light. If you had a missed call no LED notification. If you had a text no notification. You will know all these only when you turn your screen on. So you turn your phone scree on regularly to check for all these. How the heck did they design a product like this. There are many annoying things in this phone but this one simple feature missing totally pissed me off. On top to rub salt on wounds...Amazon can't do refunds on phones which is a revelation to me. I jumped in and bought this phone in the first week and now I regret trusting Samsung. I already posted it on OLX, can't keep it. My suggestion is don't rush to buy it."

142528,smartTv,"Macintosh has come a long way since its inception back in 1984 and continues to delight us with its innovation mixed with futurist thinking. This 2017 version of MacBook is basically an ‚Äòold wine in a new bottle‚Äô getting a minimal increase of 0.2 GHz in processor speed over the 2015 version. Despite having negligible changes, MacBook Air 2017 remains the best choice for the Indian masses. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Why a MacBook Air? :::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Anyone trying to get their hands on this sleek beauty should definitely ask this question to themselves. Only after getting satisfactory answers, should they go forward to even ‚Äòthink‚Äô of owning it. If you are into playing high graphics games, fancies in having terabytes of movies as a collection or gets pleasure in listening to loud music minus headphones, this device is definitely not for you to wish upon. However, if you are a frequent traveller, interested in neck-breathing performance coupled with really long battery life and is conscious of fashion etiquettes, this product is a must buy. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Positives :::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 1) Sleek and Ergonomic Design -- MacBook Air is a piece of silvery beast, ergonomically designed to appeal your senses, simultaneously making a fashion statement. 2) Quite Lightweight -- MacBook Air justifies its name, feels very light and hence much portable. 3) Excellent Backup -- Apple has definitely amazed me with the battery backup of the device which touches 11 hours on full charge. Additionally, if you leave it on sleep mode for a couple of days, it will hardly deplete even 2% each day. Don‚Äôt believe me? Try it out! 4) Lightning Fast Booting -- The device boots itself in approximately 3 seconds and takes hardly 4 seconds to shut down. 5) Sugarcoated with Solid State Drive -- Since this device used Solid State Drive (SSD) as its storage medium; it is not only super fast but also extremely quiet. 6) Fast MagSafe Charger -- Well, the Air comes with MagSafe 2, a magnetic connector which attracts your charging inlet when taken near it. The charger charges the Air from 0 to 100 percent in less than 90 minutes, which is damn fast. 7) Noise Less Front Camera -- The camera it possesses is practically noise free and can impart exceptional picture even in low lighting conditions. 8) Ambient Light Sensors -- As all of you might have known, MacBook comes with keypad lightning, not to mention the backlit Apple logo. All of these are sensor enables and thus adjusts according to the lighting conditions. 9) Ample Key Spacing -- Apple packs a well designed keyboard in a 13.3 inch laptop giving ample amount of space between the keys and this is what I call an engineering marvel. 10) Mac OS -- The presence of Mac OS is solely enough to own a MacBook, taking into factor the OS‚Äôs multi-level security, super stability, attractive GUI, virtually driver-less experience and its ability to recognise any Apple products. Additionally, having a personal assistant in name of Siri does not hurt anyone. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Negatives :::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 1) Screen Resolution -- Air is packed with LED backlit glossy display of resolution of 1440 x 900 pixels (HD Ready) with 128ppi. Not owning a laptop with at least a Full HD resolution in 2017 is surely a setback. 2) No Dedicated Graphics -- Nowadays, even basic games in the market requires a dedicated graphics and not having it clearly dismisses playing any game in this beastly device. 3) Lower Bass -- Although the device outputs good quality audio, there is a certain lack of bass being felt, which, in my opinion, could have been easily taken care of. After going through the pros and cons above, I am of the opinion that the decision making of yours will certainly be more definite. Also, be sure to look out for offers in Amazon as I got this device as low as 45K. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::: A Kind Request :::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Many of you have messaged me on Facebook asking either about the offer or about the device in details. I request anyone requiring any further help to kindly comment below this review or email me (found on my profile bio) as all your messages on facebook were in the 'Message Request' section and I did not get any notification for the same. If you are not comfortable publicly discussing, at least comment here saying 'Check your Facebook' or likewise so that I get aware of your willingness to reach me. Apologies to all who could not get my reply on time; it was unintentional."

136076,mobile,"I liked the over all performance of the mobile. But the phone gets heated if more apps are used at once. Also to mention it gets charged pretty quick... But also gets heated at the time of charging. I didn't have to charge the phone much often. Because, it didn't require that much charging thanks to its monster capacity battery life. The phone is bit heavy compared to my previous phone and is wide. It plays 1080p60 videos on YouTube. Had a good time Watching movies, series, and playing Pubg. Also it didn't consume that much of battery while playing games (Pubg). I would suggest people to buy 128GB, because the picture quality is good, and also shoots good slowmotion videos for which memory would be needed. Also, finger print sensor and face detection works best in this phone. It's has sAMOLED display which gives HD display. Pros: Good battery life Camera quality (reare as well as front) Good gaming experience Fingerprint reader Face reader sAMOLED display SAR is less than 0.5W/Kg Good Mobile look It Has Dolby Atmos so good speaker quality It Has screen mirroring Cons: Gets heated while charging Gets heated when more apps are open Heavy in weight"

134494,books,I can confirm you that there's no other book like this one. You might have seem books from arhihant etc but trust me this is all you will ever need (of course you've to read ncert books first). You can even supplement this with objective lucent (after reading subjective for revision purpose)) and necessary general science ( imo this is not really needed if you're studying for ssc or any state level exams except public service commission exams) . Conclusion: You can blindly go for this book. Lucent will take care of everything.

115306,mobile,Battar life
110616,smartTv,"A good buy for 14k Pros : 1. Screen quality is good - FHD. Useful for netflix, amazon prime and youtube. 2. Battery backup - Would last for 1.5 days on heavy usage. 3. Speakers - Dolby atmos ie fairly loud n clear. 4. Multi-tasking (without gaming) - Though its 2 gb ram, it seems faurly sufficient for daily usage. Cons: 1. Camera is pretty average - though cant expect more on a tablet. 2. Ram - With heavy gaming u feel this is a 2gb ram, with few lags. 3. Charging time is pretty slow. Takes a minimum of 2.5 hrs to charge. 4. Lack of fingerprint reader or face unlock. Overall, its a good buy for 14k when compared to ipad which is at about 21k for similar performance. If gaming is ur priority, this tab is not suggestible."
136626,refrigerator,"I purchased this product on 12th Feb 2019 and delivered and installed within 3 days. About the product it is value for money it 3 HDMI and 2 USB ports. I connect 2tb HDD and working fine, installed Jio tv able to watch all channels but issue with clarity. But other online content like YouTube am able to watch at 4k clarity. Go for it."
138501,mobile accessories,It is a very good product at it's price range but the camera quality could be more better. The battery life is no doubt work excellent. Yet while playing PUBG the mobile gets overheated & it lags when played at high resolution. Face detect & fingerprint work all fine but ram management is a little slower while opening multiple apps.
159095,mobile accessories,There's a search bar in settings and also suggestions are given to look for. The fingerprint sensor works really well even your fingers are wet. Amazing picture quality. Feels so real. Data savings are a saviour in today's world and SAMSUNG GALAXY J20 also gives you ultra data saving options too. You can also retrieve deleted photos within 15 days. And here comes the best part... My SAMSUNG GALAXY J20 can go almost 2 days without charging.!!

132113,mobile,Great phone for all type of users. Back camera quality good but never adds detailing and front camera has little bit low. Battery backup is superb if you use playing and surfing net or watching youtube it will last 36 hrs u need charge after that. Finger print sensor is good fast working. No issue in playing pubg. But i didn't like sapphire blue colour so much so please buy other two colour go for black or white

All thanks to Amazon for delivering the phone in 2days, and I was awestruck after unpacking the phone. Honestly, the phone was much more fantastic than I expected and it was worth my money.

118771,mobile,"CONS 1. I felt intermittent mild shock on back panel when I am using phone. 2. There are few MI inbuilt apps which we can neither uninstall nor avoid annoying their ads. They self update even after selecting the option ""Don't update"" in settings. 3. I've used MI Redmi 4 before whose battery was same as this, 4000mah. Comparing the discharge rate with my usage this discharges quick(even aft disabling face unlock). 4.Sometimes I don't get my downloaded photos and videos in gallery/file manager PROS 1. Rear camera is decent and less noises due to high quality sensors 2. This is one of the few phone which has less screen size with notch display(this is for those who like small screens) 3. Sound is loud and good. 4. Durable, as I slipped many times and fell on screen the display didn't break."

165463,mobile accessories,"Whereas Snapdragon 636 has 8√óKryo 260 cores clocked at up to 1.8GHz. CPU of Exynos 7904 is seeming decent than that of Snapdragon 636. Kryo 260 cores are basically is a marketing term from Qualcomm. It means four Cortex A-73 based cores and four Cortex A-53 cores. With 4 high powered cores, Snapdragon 636 can outperform Exynos 7904 with only two Cortex A-73 Cores. I can bet Exynos 7904 cannot get a higher benchmark score than Snapdragon 636. You as a buyer can buy Snapdragon 636 powered smartphone without hesitation, If Samsung has also given 4 Cortex-A-73 cores then things might be changed. Heating of smartphones is a notorious/crucial issue with Samsung during gaming, its all depends on poor GPU-graphics. Exynos 7904 is trying to sort out this problem using a Mali-G71MP2 GPU graphics, which is new. However, Snapdragon 636 has an Adreno 509 GPU. We do not have a smartphone powered by this new Exynos chipset. PROCESSOR ONLY THE PRICE CHANGES. while buying the mobile check the processor speed. i learn from the mobile because i used before redmi note 3 this mobile faster then the Samsung galaxy m20. please dont buy this product"

143596,smartTv,"NOTE: This review is addressed to that class of people for whom Rs.60000-70000 smartphone is once in five years thing. Before you judge the rating which I have given and draw conclusions, I just want to let people who read this review realize that I am after technology with some innovation and out of the box concept as I never use a smartphone beyond 12 months. In this process, I literally used every high-end smartphone that was launched after iPhone 3G (my first hold of a smartphone), be it xperia, blackberry, samsung, nexus, HTC, what not! Now, coming to the point of fake ratings. I am a bit surprised to see so many negative reviews for an iPhone 7 on Amazon. KINDLY SEE FLIPKART, without the product even launched on their site, there are 864 ratings and as much as 4.9 stars out of 5 and not a single review (I am enclosing a pic for your reference). So, there is something which doesn't catch our eye. But these are the lame tricks that get played when you go neck to neck in competition, it applies to either side. ABOUT APPLE Undoubtedly, I give huge credit to Apple for introducing smartphone concept and in the process they slowly killed the once mighty Blackberry. Like Thomas Edison, credit goes to Apple for inventing such a masterpiece. But we are still not using the same bulb which Edison has invented. There are so many companies which are reinventing bulbs every year. Apple followed it up for few years with some changes in iPhone to keep the customer base solid. There is so much hype created over every Apple launch and in the process, the adversaries tried to copy the launch styles of Apple. So, they clearly have the margin. But, they are surely lagging behind in terms of innovation. This year iPhone 7 is one that's a perfect example. COMING TO THE PHONE Watched the launch event so closely, like I always do every year. I was using an iPhone 6 and was waiting for 7 (I have had an occasion to handle and experience both iPhone 7 and 7 plus even before they were launched in India). And finally ended up with Galaxy S7 Edge for a reason (BEFORE COMMENTING, RE-READ WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN IN THE FIRST TWO PARAGRAPHS OF MY REVIEW). I opted for S7 Edge for its curvy screen design with brilliant colours and the camera which beats the iPhone The dual camera on iPhone 7 plus is not new to the world before its launch. Secondly, they have their eyes set for the 10th Annniversary of iPhone in 2017 and are holding their cards till then. Both iOS and Android have their own pros and cons. This is the area which I am carefully and deliberately side lining and focusing on the phone. This year launch of iPhone 7 is only for those geeks, unlike me, who actually stick to iPhone for life and for whom the price tag is just a symbol to flaunt. Honestly, as most of the Apple users agree, what matters is the design of the phone. If i see a person standing about 5 feet away from me with an iPhone 7 (not plus) and me holding my iPhone 6, a third person will obviously think we are using the same phone (not talking about brand). So, if I were to shell Rs.60000 for a phone which retains the same design crafted with precision for three straight years, I better buy a device which satisfies me with its looks and performs as closely as an iPhone but loses the battle. And with Rs.20000 cheaper. I put my chips in there. Unless you have to run tasks which need some significant power like Games, it's not worth an upgrade or a first time buy.l I would request people to just think a bit before investing your hard earned money to go for iPhone 7. Join the line in which I am standing for the ""revolutionary"" design of an iPhone 8 in 2017. Because, that's when Apple is gonna show again to the world that they are masters of innovation. All the best!"

112131,mobile,"Amazing Phone, the battery life of this phone is simply amazing"
166028,mobile,"Worst camera. Leave about 48MP, after looking at the pics(in mobile, not PC/laptop) you will feel like pictures were taken from some kind of 2MP or age-old 8MP camera. The battery is good but not up to the mark, for 6000mah you would expect it to last for minimum 2 days at least with basic usage(no movies/games/heavy browsing etc..) like calls and checking notifications, messaging, etc. It lasted for just 28 hours for me with basic usage. Charging time was around 3hrs. Wifi coverage is also limited. It doesn't connect if I am in different room which was not the case with real me and One Plus phone. The only best thing is the display. I think this mobile has got the best display under 15K range. If your only priority is display then nothing can beat this mobile under 15K. And the worst part is that there is no replacement for this mobile, only refund. I believe replacement was not given considering the additional 1000 cashback which will be credited to the seller if they refund the amount, not sure though. Seller - STPL Exclusive Online."

I watched YouTube videos, which are not clear . Video display quality is not at all good .Speaker sound is low. The processor in this phone is mediatek Helio P70 ,which is also used MOTOROLA ONE MACRO which costs only RS.9999/- only.

154136,smartTv,"Shifted from android to iOS. I realise now.. Android was just a toy, a simulator. Actual joy of using a smartphone is actually only in iPhones. Beautiful, powerful and peaceful device (free from almost all chote chote issues which we generally compromise with androids). The phone actually ‚Äòhelps‚Äô us to manage it better. Example, it has an option, wether to use the volume buttons to reduce phone ring sounds or not. (Since sometimes while reducing volume of the video, we erroneously and unknowingly reduce the phone ringing sound.. and we miss some very important calls.. until we realise the mistake). It already has a physical silent button to use it when necessary without going through all the process of opening the phone- settings- shortcuts etc just to make the phone silent or vice versa. Battery although below 2000mah, performance is alike 3000 mah battery in androids. Use it and you can find the many many chote chote bate in it that makes your life easy and peaceful. And yes Interphase is very very simple without unnecessary clumsy designs but still ‚Äòvery premium feeling‚Äô too. The click, the keyboard sound, the switch sound, the touch, the smoothness, the feel... all ‚Äòwow‚Äô!!! Worth buying. Even at this cost, still a value for money/ value for peace!!!"

142814,mobile,MiA2 is a disaster! The company tried to make a stock android phone but guess their engineers were not equipped to do the job. The phones software is not compatibile with the hardware and this results in the below mentioned issues:- 1. Major lag issues on using different aps 2. Shuts down randomly and refuses to boot again 3. Occasionally hangs and becomes non responsive The company should ideally take back all the phone from the market and rework on it. I would have given a 0 rating to the phone but giving atleast 1 rating is a criteria.

142550,mobile,Main thing which i considered while burying this phone camara and battery. I had been using since 1 day. Camara is not actually look like 48mp texture of the photos look like old phone photos and it doesn't feel like pro camera i had compared with this phone to redmi note 5 pro which has far better than this camara. Battery was good but phone heats up on top of the portion i don't know why!! Coming to the privacy part there is no inbuilt app lock and notification hide feature which is a big drawback for me you can't hide notifications while you or someone using your phone if you really want to buy the phone for Camara it is better to not to buy this. on 15k you go for different options. Lastly overall experience with this phone is mixed one!
167634,mobile,dead phone deliver

139590,mobile accessories,"It's been 5 days only that I have bought this product.... Cons: -10m bluetooth connectivity is a myth, it only supports upto 3-5 m. -wires are not quite durable or thick. -Bass is lower than average. -not durable for long run -ears starts to pain after a use of 30min. Pros: -gets charged quickly. -light weight -gets connected quickly,no problem in connection. So, for me this product is lower than average.Now it's up to you,so think twice before buying thus product."

136330,mobile,I m using this phone since last 4 months... Its screen is not working well... Touch is not working well.. I m so worried about it... Dont buy this product.. 4 months very good... But 5th month not working properly....
133605,mobile accessories,"I am a genuine buyer of this phone and really astonished to see so many good reviews of this phone. I had to sell it one week later at a loss of 4k on cashify. Firstly I don't like that yellowish tint on screen which all Samsung phones have-- this one too has it. The camera quality is the real disappointment specially in indoor lights, they have failed to develop proper algo to interlace the pics from 3 cameras properly. Oppo and Vivo phones in same range offer 45 MP camera and have much better picture quality. Processor is also not satisfying, it's some old age one. Playing pubg with reduced graphics is the only option. Finger sensor is inferior to other same range phones... though it takes 1 sec to open the phone but practically 1sec is quite annoying. Others do it much faster. Amazon did not give any option to return it within 10 days and neither was I allowed to post any review earlier so posting it now after 2-3 months of it's launch. GOOD THINGS: Battery life is really great, it lasts for at least 2-3 days. Screen resolution and picture quality is very good. Lookwise it is a decent one."
164228,mobile,"Very nice phone,touch screen is nice also speakar is very good sound quality."

110508,mobile,A best all-rounder mobile phone in all Aspects.
149635,mobile,"Overall great phone and honestly it's a steal. I was a Samsung phone hater(mid-range segments) and preferred mi and realme but now the tables have turned. Based on my 10 days usage these are the things I noted(4GB variant):- 1)Great Battery Backup (lasts almost 2 days in normal usage and more than one day with heavy usage). 2)The sAmoled display and the touch response is great. 3)The speaker is decent and there is no problem in Calling which I felt bad in redmi devices but their 4g speed is greater than this phone(100 to 200 kbps difference only)not alarming maybe due to the snapdragon processor(which is better than exynos in power efficiency and performance). 4)The exynos 9611 is snappy,fast won't say power efficient because I think if they would have put snapdragon processor then the battery would have lasted for 3 days straight. Day to day usage and multi tasking is good may be due to lpddr4 ram and ufs 2.1 storage. 5)Camera qualty is ok. Trust me 48mp is just for marketing I can't see any difference in normal 12mp photos infact I liked 12 mp photos with hdr enabled and has more clarity than 48 mp. The dynamic range is good.u won't get the sharpness mainted after zooming the photos but kind of ok .wide angle camera also great but struggles in low light.Selfie camera is average and struggles in low light I felt decent only there is not much detailing that u could see in other devices like mi and realme in this segment. Infact I think it's ok because it's main sensor and selfie sensor is wider than the camera's used in other phones therefore there is a little blur at the sides of the focus point when u zoom the photos. The camera app has many features like slo-mo,I personally liked the ar face feature, night mode is crap. Video recording is very good with eis,sound recording is also good. Overall the camera is ok but if u want the best camera then go for apple ,oneplus and gcam fully enabled phones. 6)The samsung One UI is I perfect,elegant and snappy to use I used lean launcher to look more beautiful. 7)Design is good and in hand feel is also excellent. 8)Built quality is low because it dosen't have a gorilla glass protection and the back cover is very light that when I pressed the sides a clicking sound is produced but it's ok.I would highly recommend a screen protector and back case. 9)while keeping the camera app open the phone gets heated up a little and gets heated on the top portion of the phone.But it was suprising to see that the phone cools down very fast. After reading all this if ur still confused to buy this phone then wait till 2100üòÅ to buy the best phone at budget price."

120141,books,"Curious about the buzz this book has generated, I picked it up, prepared to be inspired. I wasn't. It's a nice little fable -- one that you could even read to your kids -- but I didn't find in it any wisdom for the ages. Here's the basic message: ""Trust your intuition. Follow your dreams."" Heard it before? Yeah, I thought so. There really aren't any deep thoughts in the The Alchemist. It's basically a kind of New Age fairy tale. It exhorts you to think big but doesn't really make you think too much. Some have compared it to Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet. Not even close. That thin volume makes you stop every few sentences to ponder its wisdom. It's not much of a story but it's definitely deep. The Alchemist is exactly the opposite: an endearing little story but no great strain on the intellect. Maybe it will cheer you up. Maybe it will give you the encouragement you need to chase your dream. If so, you probably didn't need much of a boost in the first place."

Camera is good only but no natural color production. Spending 37k for a phone without having a headphone or pop up camera with disgusting battery life is not acceptable. Only gimmick 90hz display and oxygen os will not take this brand to touch the same level as iPhone. Really disappointed.

158984,mobile accessories,There is a major problem with this device which is the proximity sensor doesn't function properly. Battery life is decent. Goes for a day. Great display. You really don't have to worry that it's a 720p display because it's got a good one. Speakers are good. Moving on to the camera the rear camera is great but the front camera is just trash. Though it's a 32mp camera the pictures come really grainy and the pictures aren't well processed. Hope they fix it with an update. Got a great body. Has a nice premium feel to it. I personally love the stock feel. It give super clean look to it. Fingerprint sensor works fine but as it's a small one you have to put your finger on that specific area.

111889,mobile,"All the highlights are good but when it comes to your personal daily experiences, you will be irritated by the use. It might be because of stock Android, or Android one, whatever they call it, but there are little things which you use mostly, which are not at all good, lengthy. It lags too, gaming experience is just okay, not too satisfactory. I would not recommend this and either of Mi or Vivo or oppo, based on personal experience. All they have is ones problem as another's solution and so on. Difficulty wise, What you face in oppo has been resolved in Vivo and what you face in Vivo is resolved in Mi, and so on. Neither of them provides a phone which makes you work properly. They are economical by features but not at all satisfying in the end after few months use."

120237,mobile accessories,"Dear friends, Apple iPhone is undoubtedly an overrated phone with lesser features than other reputed brands available for 1/3rd price. We use the phone for maximum 1-2 years & what's the point in buying an overpriced iPhone, when other reputed brands phones with much better features are available for 70% lesser price and has the same durability like an iPhone. It's just a hype they create by releasing new model iPhone once in 8 months to manipulate & tempt the foolish people to buy the new model by wasting their money by exchanging their previous model iPhone for very less price. Foolish people are making the clever company rich without thinking about the real plans of Apple (marketing gimmick & nothing special in quality, but highly priced). Please think well before spending your hard earned money on an iPhone.... Donate the same extra money you spend, to some needy people instead of wasting it by paying to a rich company like Apple."

159767,smartTv,This is my first Kindle device and i am extremely impressed with the overall feel of using such a device The display resolution of 167 PPI is completely adequate and the newly added feature of a built in backlight just renders the paperwhite a useless buy. Buying this instead of the paperwhite now makes much more sense as in feel a customer will not feel the lower display resolution or the lack of weather sealing This is also just a wifi model and cellular connectivity is not required since most places now have either public wifi or you can just hook this up to your phone via hotspot The batery life as usual with kindle devices is amazing as i have only charged this once since it got delivered to me on 11th April and the battery remains still as 55% !!! Upon pre-ordering got a free eBook and 2 years of extended warranty which is just absolutely amazing 10/10 would recommend

AR emoji to play with and ""best shot"" function to guides you take perfect shots every time you click. Night mode is epic, it has clearest night mode in this bracket. Most of the times my hands arn't clean, face recognition comes in handy, fingerprint sensor is responsive but takes a while to unlock phone. Awesome grip on this phone but I suggest you to have a back cover because of plastic body it is prone to scratches.

156406,mobile,"Superfast delivery by Amazon, full marks. (Please note, its not even 24hrs complete to my use) Display is amazing but there is not much like 48MP for Camera, my old Honor 7x used to click similar or better clicks. Facing a big issue of mobile network Connectivity, had to restart my phone frequently for carrier network to catch it, dont know whats the problem. After 4-5 restart and reset network finally it has started working. Fingerprint sensor is not quick enough, again my Honor7x was faster than this. The nig claim abt battery holds good for now, consumption is quite gradual wrt use, so good for now, but Fast charger is not fast enough compared to the size of 6k mAh and time it takes to make it 100% Initial setup, Galaxy store gave me headache by installing apps which are popular (i absolutely didn't want any of them). Design is good, imp there is dedicated sim slot, (not hybrid). Low on phone speakers output, have missed few calls though on loud and vibrate mode. Didnt see inbuilt AppLock (as it is found in most of other handsets. can download from playstore but inbuilt would be good) Light weight it is, doesnt feel like 6k mAh batter phone. Seen many cool settings inside, (yet to explore all) Will update this review after a week. For now, its good to go at this price and on this festival sale. ================================ Update After Weeks use: ============================= Camera is just average, 48Mp sounds good on product description only. Samsung Skin lacks many good features (at least i miss much of my Honor EMUI features) like: Using Fingerprint for clicking selfie blocking spam message sender (like AX-Soft, IM-Loans etc). This was again pretty easy with Honor UI. Photo filters variety is not enough (this is not a big think as 3rd party apps or even Instagram has more than enough) but inbuilt would be a good deal. disconnecting call lags for 2secs, sometimes i wonder if call is disconnected really or not. Fingerprint sensor is not quick enough. (again comparing with Honor) faced lock screen google Ads issue, got it sorted but that was kind of turn off. RAM management can be better, i see 1.2-1,4 free RAM only out of 4GB (500MB shows reserved though) also this doesnt hanged ever till now. SloMo video can be of only 2-3 secs length (i might be missing some tricks, but could nt find on google either) Battery backup is decent, easily lasts 1.5 day with normal usage (am not a gamer)"
144511,smartTv,Nice 1 Thanks amazon
118457,mobile,"Bought this in an exchange offer which took my father's old Redmi Note 3 for Rs. 4000. Buying this wasn't in the plan, but I needed a second phone anyways to cut the load on my old OnePlus 3, and since this is an Android ONE device, I was OK with getting it as a secondary phone as I practically hate MIUI and the ads and bloatware it comes with. As soon as it was delivered, I unboxed it and started setting it up after which I started installing available updates. Everything was going fine, and I was kind of excited with the feel of a new phone, plus this is really a pretty phone, thin, light, superb camera, affordable, stock Android and whatnot. I was delighted until the phone started installing the February security update. It asked for a reboot to which I tapped YES, and then it never booted again and got stuck on ANDROID ONE boot screen forever. At first, I thought, Okay, this update might take a while, but after an hour or so, it was still stuck there. I shook the Google down for the issue and came to know that this is a known issue with the February update and if you are unlucky enough, you might brick your device with that update. To unbrick the device, one need to remove the back lid of the phone and push some button on the circuit or maybe short two points on the board. I was furious inside, thinking about WHY DID I TRUST XIAOMI? It is Android ONE device, but the manufacturer is still the very company which in the name of cost-cutting, delivers cheap and flawed devices. I rushed to the nearest MI Service centre, where they told me to lodge a replacement with Amazon as they are not authorised to open a device which is not 7 days old at the least. And they asked me to get my replaced phone updated via their service centre only to prevent the same thing to happen next time. I contacted Amazon CC, they were helpful, asked me to mail the bricked device's pictures, and they issued the replacement. The new phone arrived in a couple of days which after all the replacement formalities, I took directly to the MI Service Centre for the update. They took nearly 45 minutes to bring my phone to the latest stable build. Brought it back and started setting it up again. Installed all my battery hungry apps like Facebook, Messenger, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc. on this phone and removed the same from my OnePlus3. This is a good-good phone. I really like - - Sleekness. It is one of the prettiest phones I've used so far. - Being Android ONE device, it manages the resources pretty well. - Camera quality is beyond what I could've asked for at this price. - Smooth touch operations. - Battery life is decent keeping in mind that is is one of the sleekest phones. - Headphone Type-C to 3.5mm jack was included in the box. I didn't like - - Camera's autofocus and manual focus are kind of weird. Or, maybe, I'm going to take a little more time to get used to the focus. - The screen is not so sturdy. Got one scratch already by only keeping it in the pocket with my other phone which is also without any screen protection. - Minimal IR remote support, unlike other MI devices."
127545,smartTv,Good Quality Product in this low cost
153353,mobile,Redmi 6A is a good option for a budget of 6000. Pros - The performance of this device is good and stands perfect on the expectations of user demand. Good battery backup and screen quality. One more advantage is that it has a dedicated microsd card slot which help it to expand its memory. Cons - There is no demerit in this device but i think the company should have given the IR blaster on this device as they were giving in the previous phones in same price range. Overall the device is perfect for a budget of 6000.

125658,mobile accessories,Good
143035,mobile,"Mobile phone design and user interface are good. Below are the points which needs improvement. (1) Camera can't focus while capturing images from short distance (like 1 to 3 feet far from an object or from a document) (2) Face unlock doesn't work sometimes in low light Let's hope Samsung will work on above points in further updates. Below are some other cons. (1) Fast charging is not much fast (2) Battery lasts good, but can't say a monster one (3) Side body feels like clicking while holding Display, Sound quality, Dual VoLTE support, Dedicated SD card slot are good features of this mobile phone. Overall user exprience is good. Each product have it's own pros and cons. Overall it is a good mobile phone."

126228,smartTv,Good
122640,mobile accessories,"Excellent phone for any usage. I have gamed, used this as a media consumption device and as a phone in general. It was very quick and responsive and the screen clarity is still very good despite the 720p HD+ panel. AMOLED has worked its magic yet again. However, the animation of the fingerprint is very long making it seem slow. The reader is very fast and responsive but the animation makes it feel slow. It is an overall excellent phone. would recommend. Maybe not as fast as other phones but guaranteed updates for 2 years and security updates for 3 years, does have its charm. It is no slow phone by any means but it is not faster than the newer arrivals like Realme XT and Redmi note 8 pro. It also has flagship cameras, a triple camera setup that hits well beyond its league."
139869,smartTv,It's missing a few basic things 1- No back-lit keyboard 2- No indication of caps locks on/off
124714,mobile accessories,"GOOD: + water resistant - this is a huge improvement for me! +increased speed is noticeable w Siri. +the capacity is amazing! I can keep movies, videos, books, photos, music etc without having to store on iCloud or the like (which usually involves a monthly fee). + decent size (same as iPhone 6S) while remaining portable and although not as big as the 7 Plus, it can still fit in pocket. +Widget feature (swiping to right at home screen) has been improved and now allows editing. You can add or delete features which can be key for privacy and being able to customize is always a good thing. +has lots of added fun features in iMessage (not sure if its the updated software or strictly iPhone 7) like memes, automatic replies and being able to write w your fingertip. +camera takes much better pics (increased the megapixels and the difference is noticeable) and it has 5X zoom capability. +has the fingerprint option for quicker access after you enter your 6 digit pass code to begin. +even slimmer than the iPhone 6 but still able to stand up against something for convenient viewing. +speaker upgrade as it now provides stereo (not up to audiophile standards but still). BAD: - no headphone jack!! but box includes dongle (see photo) which inserts into charging port and provides headphone jack - I have a bet with myself on how long it will take to lose. I know wireless headphones are the future but happy with my old faithful headphones. -the home button is not as well defined. Its gonna take longer than 24 hrs to get used to as it takes me a few tries to activate the home button. It requires the right amount of pressure and despite offering three different options, not easy. The guys at the Apple Store need to stop showing off - on the bright side, I'm thinking it's a learning curve thing and continued use should take care of this issue."
139638,mobile,It's best product in the price range.

159961,mobile accessories,This is the best phone from Samsung you can get in this Price. It has a 5000 mAH battery with a fast charger inside the box. I bet no other company provides a 15W fast charger inside the box under 20000. It has Super Amoled Display. And M30 got its 1.1 Version of One UI which uses Android Pie. Doesn't heat even after playing Pubg for long. Camera quality is Decent. Fingerprint is fast enough. What surprised me was it's face unlock. Best phone under 15K

157628,smartTv,"The front side of the phone carries the 32MP selfie camera Redmi Y3 is a good smartphone overall, with decent looks, good performance, rear cameras and battery. The display is quite vibrant and sharp for a smartphone at this price point. Redmi Y3 sports a dual camera setup on the back consisting of a 12MP primary sensor paired with a 2MP secondary depth sensor."
137145,mobile accessories,I was using Iphone 6 and was happy with it so tried to upgrade but this phone is total downgrade. Neither the centre button is mechanic anymore nor it has separate place to put earphone jack and it is impossible to charge and play music simultaneously and with disgusting battery backup of Iphone this phone is a complete disaster. Music and other applications have also difficult and time wasting steps. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PHONE

123155,refrigerator,Except 2 neglible dents both lower sides... The item itself is awesome... I would say Amazon should take some responsibility about the dents... Most of the buyers have complaints about heavey appliances which are bought online.... When you buy a dented fridge... Amazon is ready to replace it... But what the heck... You keep that heavy appliance moving...you end up without fridge for a while... Why don't they just compensate with some thing like accessories!!
167066,smartTv,a somewhat ok product.doesnt have the expected sound.
158199,smartTv,The phone looks pretty good..blue colour is awesome..gifted to my husband on his birthday..arrived on the same day..camera quality is average..sound quality n battery life are good..the major disappointing part was that it does not have headset..
123838,mobile,"Finger print sensor is not promt, one have to place full finger to unlock the phone. Infact finger print reader space is too narrow. However face unlocking is superb and very much prompt. Battery and display is superb. Camera is good. However wide angel camera quality in low light is not much good. No specification about the material of display glass. Some reviews says it is prone to scratch."

159863,smartTv,This is one of the best MI phone in this price range because of its camera quality. The selfie camera is just beyond expectation while the only thing I didn't liked is the packaging as the phone box was not covered with bubble wrap as I think it should be well except that everything is great. You will get a MI charger with USB cable and a key with this phone. The colour I ordered was blue and that is so beautiful as the back portion is totally reflecting and you can see your face in that so it's a great advantage for girls. üòúüòÜ

Although it gets fully charged in less than an hour but it also gets drained very fast. In my first couple of weeks use, it was perfect but after that it is highly disappointing. I fully charge my phone in the morning and leave it at my home without any use. Back from office after 10 hours when I check the phone 70 - 80% of the charge is drained off without any use as I use this phone only in my home."

Its finger print sensor detects very slow, battery backup is not upto the mark, discharges very fast, more over the packing from Amazon is very very very poooooor as it has come in mobile box & further Amazon has put his cover and forwarded without any additional protection, now slowly heating problem started. So choose wisely."

112576,mobile,Amazing smartphone. Super fast charger. Battery percentage reached 77% from 15% only in 26 mins. Thanks to Warp charging. The phone is super fast. I noticed a lot of difference from my previous phone (RN5 Pro) when it comes to paying using Paytm. The photos are coming really good. Especially the photos that are shot in low light. The camera app itself suggests - based on the environment -when we should use the Wide landscape option. The only con is the unavailability of head phone jack. I wish OnePlus had provided the Type-C to 3.5mm adapter in the phone's package. Otherwise it costs ‚Çπ390 in Oneplus stores. Just go for it if you're looking for an upgrade. I trust you won't regret.
128876,books,Good ones
111410,mobile,After unboxing I just recieved only accesories...there was no phone in the box... please don't buy this phone in this sale

138759,smartTv,It is running on Ubuntu 16.04. If you want a laptop for HEAVY gaming purpose then this is is not the one as it comes with 2GB AMD Radeon graphics which are not that sufficient.(although it can support any heavy game till 2015) Overall it's Good. Speakers produce decent sound. DO NOT have 1080p Full HD Display. If you want it for normal usage (no gaming)then go for integrated graphics unlike this one as extra 2gb graphics consumes extra battery. If you are not a big fan of DELLBranding then go for ASUS OR LENOVO and see if they are providing 2GB Nvidia graphics. (Heavy Gamers)
164865,smartTv,Volume is too low.. sound quality is also poor.. even it is non-returnable just a waste of money
113486,mobile accessories,"Avoid buying this.

Picture parameters (brightness/contrast/saturation/sharpness) can be adjusted to user-taste. Comparable to Smart TVs of recognised brands at much higher price. Two HDMI inputs sufficient for HD cable source (with WiFi) and Amazon Fire Stick. Netflix and Amazon Prime apps already installed and usable for paid subscribers. Also YouTube and several other apps. Amazon Fire Stick widens the range. USB ports (2 nos) with pen drive or hard disc inputs allows viewing of movie downloads in most popular formats. Used now for one month with no complaints."

141291,mobile,"Just recently i ordered realme u1 from amazon and based on my usuage for a week, i am extremely satisfied with the phone...so far there is no lag and the phone doesnt get heated up fast while playing games, excellent picture quality and awesome battery. Its worth mentioning that its one of the best among low budget phones."
136615,mobile,"I purchased this product after watching many online review videos and trusting brand Samsung that they must have improved their game in the last 5 years since I abandoned them. My overall experience is horrible! 1. The phone is terribly, terribly slow. It takes two seconds to unlock using the fingerprint scanner. Takes 1 second to launch simple apps like Messaging or Whatsapp. 2. The rear camera blows everything out of proportion. The colors, lighting etc. everything is blown out. Even an older device like iPhone 6 clicks much better and natural photographs. 3. The front camera is a farce. It tries to hide it's incompetence using artificial processing which means as soon as you zoom-in the image gets distorted. 4. The display is awesome. However, the auto-brightness doesn't works because there is no sensor at all. It relies on front camera and by the time it sense the lighting conditions they have most likely changed. 5. Notification options are too many and confusing. Could have been much simpler, I mean WHY??? and the lock screen does not lights up whenever there are any notifications, sometimes it will if it feels like. 6. Even the battery is not awesome. My POCO F1 delivered much better battery performance in a 4000 mAH battery. And it takes FOREVER, to charge this battery using the supplied charger. Like FOREVER!"

136524,smartTv,"I purchased an i7b256 gb ssd model from a store nearby. But I am writing this review so that it helps others to decide whether to buy or not. Firt of all this is a beast. But some cons are.. Hdd is not fast compared to dell and rog laptops. But SSD is fast... Build quality is good btw but u feel like the screen is shaking.. When you type fast. If you buy 128 gb ssd. Then u can't use it to its full. So buy 256. PROS Ips 120hz display.. This thing is impossible in this price range. 1060 6 gb nvidia graphics.. It is just a beast. Except for screen everything is strong.. ""TUF"" Fan makes low/no noise.. I game continously for 6 to 8 hours.. And I don't feel any overheating issue.. But laptop gets heated.. And the same way it cools down.. Red backlit is actually good than rgb cuz in night when i used rgb keyboards i feel dizzyness and my eyes sometimes ache.. But this has only one colour and it is comfortable for my eyes.. My suggestion Do BIOS update regularly to maintain the stability.. Cuz there are many drives and u need to take care of them. Take a usb backup of windows 10. Keep fan in boost mode. When playing intense game. Do not use third party apps to increase fan voltage. Use keyboard and touchpad gaurd... If you are searching for a beast in this price range then definitely this is the one."

You will be surprised when you use. 1. Best in RAM management. 2. Battery works fine for 1.5 days. 3. Selfie camera is awesome. 4. Rear camera lags in low light. 5. UI is wonderful. 6. P70 processor is awesome. No lag, quick boot up and loading of apps. I am fully satisfied. Go for it."
135192,mobile,"I have been using this phone for over 2 weeks now. I feel the fingerprint sensor is not sensitive enough, having used MI phones before this handset, it had more sensitive fingerprint sensors. The plastic body of the phone is not appealing as well. It makes a slight creaking sound when you press the sidesl. Performance wise it has been good. Camera is good. Battery life is great. Overall a decent handset."
137384,mobile,"I'm writing this review after at least two months of using this phone. I'd still say it is worth it. However, I have been experiencing some touchscreen issues of late. There is a touchscreen responsiveness latency quite a number of times I have noticed. Also, if you are not a fan of the unavailability of the headphone jack, I suggest don't go for this phone as it doesn't have too great a battery to back it up. You won't be able to charge the phone and use headphones simultaneously (unless they are Bluetooth ones, which could again drain more battery). My verdict of this phone right now, as I experience touchscreen issues while typing this review, is: be cautious and look for a better phone, with a better battery life and not something that inconveniences you. This phone isn't all bad though despite the review. Camera is the only best thing about this phone."
111287,mobile,"After I bought it, it was good only for one month, after that the performance started lagging. The mobile got to get slow and stuck often times.

160403,mobile,This phone is truly a battery beast. If you want to gift this phone to your parents like i did. Then this is the Best phone you can gift. I bought this device after alot of research and shortlisted 3 best selling mobile but this phone fullfilled all my requirements. This phone has everything which we use in our daily lives. Like FM radio. Call recording. Gaming mode. Faster cooling. I've been a fanboy of Samsung since quite a long time and the innovation and specs that they are providing with the price is totally worth. I don't have any problem with this device. Things which i liked the most- 1. Beast Battery 2. Camera performance 3. Super steady video mode 4. Software experience 5. Fast charging (18W fast charging) 6. Display and also always on display like flagship phones 7. Fingerprint reader is decently fast 8. Dedicated SD card slot which not many brands provide 9. Gaming mode 10. No lag at all in HDR settings with ultra graphics in PUBG. And cooling mode gets activated automatically to cool the device. Things which i don't like- 1. Build quality could have been better. It feels a little plasticy but its totally fine as you are gonna have a cover or case on it almost everytime. 2. Samsung should have included earphones in the box. 3. Back is prone to scratches so you have to laminate it or something. That's all.
151498,mobile,Portrait camera is useless and completely dependent on AI. Two camera in the camera is uselsss as its buggy and cannot focus properly. Battery as compared to other phones in same range is less. Plus point about the phone its having Full Hd screen with drop notch. Processing is more or less same as compared to others but fast. Color Os is lacking many features.

After charging on first day, the next day the charge didn't even gone down below 60%. I liked the color also. Overall I would rate 4.8 out of 5 because the thing which I didn't like was in built apps like Netflix which I could not uninstall. I also didn't like is not got headphones within the box. You should have given at least a headphone with the set. But if anyone asks me about recommendation I will recommend him/her this phone."

135401,smartTv,"I have purchased the Iphone7 from http://amzn.to/2iEnvwL in good discount from Seller - Techoholic. Apple iPhone 7 (Jet Black, 128GB) Yes you can get cool smartphone features for ~‚Çπ30k. The premium price you pay for the iPhone 7 gives you guaranteed software updates for minimum 3 years, awesome integration of software/hardware and tight integration within the Apple ecosystem. Since, it is the current flagship iPhone it will still be blazing fast and get most (if not all) of the software features when the next generation is released in fall 2017. One of the best features in this year's iPhone is that the home button is no longer a physical button -- so it cannot ""break"" in the traditional sense. Added water resistance is definitely a plus and something which was long overdue though I would recommend that one does not test it personally -- if somehow water does enter the phone's casing, Apple will consider it out of warranty. (Out of warranty replacement costs ~‚Çπ25.5k for 128 GB iPhone) To save money, one can get the 32GB version (it is plenty) or explore other options like the 6s or the SE."

153159,mobile,"Reasons to Buy- Pros-: 1.Looks and Apearance (4.8/5)- Lookwise its a good product in its range,Screen looks like curve which is held only in expensive sets,back cover is also so attractive. 2.RAM(4.5/5)- Better processing than M30 . 3.Storage(4.9/5)- Best in class,as it gives more space for internal memory as other handsets,it provides upto 61 GB availability. 4.Operation( 4.5/5)- Smoother due to samsung chipset. 5.Touchpad (4.2/5)- quick responding than others that i found previously use oppo and realme handsets. 6.Display(4.9/5)- As always good as Amoled screeen is provided its always better than IPS display. 7. Battary (5.0/5.0)- As high 6000Mh it performance is nice 1.5 day for 95%-10%. 8.Charging(4.8/5.0)- 15W fast chargingis also a good feature for this handset to be prefer.It take only 2.5-3 hrs to charge high rating battary. Other Reasons (4.8/5.0)-- Low heating after continues use as compared to others. Less head SAR value (.468) Expensive look. Cons-: 1. Camera(4.0/5)- As 48 MP primary camera ,its not so satisfying. 2.Weight(4.0/5)- Just a little bulky. Overall Rating after 7 day use by me- (4.7/5.0)"

Stock android is just ""makkhhan"" with Android Pie. Blindly go for it, no other product will give you at this price point as it gives. A big thumbs up üëç"

119907,mobile accessories,"Colour is awesome, amazing display, very slim design,& battery life is also good. Best thing is it has got dual sim slots & also a dedicated memory card slot.Camera is ok.Good deal with this price.Thank you Amazon for fast delivery."
156313,mobile,"Superb product. Totally happy with it. Bought it on Great Indian Sale and got cashback as well as instant discount. Its main attraction is its monsterous battery. It will last for 1 and a half day for mediam usages but for heavu usage it should last a day (12 to 14 hours). Camera quality is preety good. And the display is also very bright as well as colourful. Totally satisfied with it. But it has some drawbacks as well, its fingerprint sensor is fast but not as fast as other phones in recent times. I should say its 3 out of 5. Another thing is its front camera. It is little bit soft as compare to its megapixels. It also struggle in low light conditions. Another important security drawback is that it didn't provide any private mode or private space for personal pictures and files. Although Samsung provides it on its other divices like A series phones but not in vase of budget phones. Its an issue who have used it earlier. But samsung can easily fix it with an ota update. Overall its a worth buying phone. You can go with it without any hesitations. I think 4+64 GB is worth buying option than 6+128. Both of them are same except the storage. I think the higher varient is rs. 1000 overpriced as compare to 4,64 gb varient."

113089,mobile accessories,"As i m one plus user , earlier using One Plus 3t , now exchanged with One Plus 7 , but didn't find any thing new , it's my assumption by using One Plus 3t , Nothing changed, increasing ROM , Or Camera Quality , But was Very Happy with One Plus 3t as it was slim , mettalic body , Light weight , It is heavy , Unnecessary Costly , I think it is very Good For someone who has never used one Plus Batery life good , but if I talk about screen quality , Nothing like Samsung Note 8 (that my friend got in 27k in Big sale time ) or Note 10 .. Moreover good for some one who is new to One Plus family But I m not as happy as I was with One Plus 3T üòä Compare things , take decesion wisely , Money Matters ,"

133767,books,I am not giving two stars for book but for product defect. I got the book in good condition but 6 pages are not printed.
132365,smartTv,"Great product! Though the sound isn‚Äôt that loud but plays really well from this compact yet powerful box. It charges fast, and I am loving the colour! ‚ô•Ô∏è"
167517,smartTv,better picture quality for that price. use android TV box for better upscaling feature.
135825,mobile,"I like the color ( would have have liked the cord too be of the same color). Very portable, fits into reasonable size pant pocket along with mobile. good batrery backup."
157474,smartTv,The complete bill is not given with the box.
163125,smartTv,"Very good media consumption device at this price range. Screen quality is very good. Excellent battery life. Nice speakers, decent camera for video calling, Most disappointing is the slow processor and RAM. With 3-4 apps open (including chrome), it becomes very slow in responding. But with 2GB ram, nothing more is expected. Good for simple usage - checking mails, viewing photos, video calls, browsing (online shopping*), news reading, media apps** etc. Definitely not multitasking even though it allows split screen - small apps would work fine. Noticed some bugs - *Amazon India app is buggy for this tablet. it already gives a notification - 'app is not optimized for this screen size'. But amazon.com works perfectly fine. I don't know if any other apps are not optimized for the tablet size. **Hotstar, Netflix, YouTube etc are fine - except Hotstar gives a white bar at the bottom(from navigation button's bar). This is so annoying for me because there is dark background in the video and then bright bar!!) . ------------------------------ Nevertheless this is a wonderful and sleek tablet at the price range. So, 5 stars from me. If it had 3GB ram even at Rs.1000 extra, it would become the king in the segment."
150595,mobile,Phone is heating whithin 30 min when using Internet and not satisfied display size very short compair with other branded mobiles

144481,mobile,Nice
110495,mobile,"A Very affordable all rounder with good camera, performance and battery life along with promised android 10 update. Better than MI A3, Samsung A50, A50s. Design 4/5 Display 5/5 Audio: 5/5 Battery: 5/5 Software 5/5 Performance: 5/5 Introduction, Design and Display: Samsung M series is an India focused smartphone series sold my Samsung to specially cater to the likes of Indian consumers. These phones have good specs for low price, but the android OS (One UI) put in these phones is not as feature rich as A series phones. This doesn't make much difference but some features such as display modes, camera algorithms are limited as compared to A series. Furthermore this phone is listed to get android 10 (android Q) update. The Design of the phone is nice, I bought the Pearl white variant. Keep in mind that there is NO GLASS BACK. The phone back is made out of good quality smooth plastic. White color looks really good like google pixel phones. There is a sAMOLED FHD+ notch display in the front. A small chin at the bottom of the display. The display has really good color reproduction and high contrast ratio i.e. the black color in this phone is much much darker than black colors of LCD display phones. The colors are vibrant. You can control the color warmth and vividness. Samsung has an expertise in making displays and has been making excellent sAMOLED displays since many years (even for other smartphone companies). Audio is also loud and clear with no sound distortion. one speaker on the bottom of phone. It has Dolby Atmos built-in for headphones. Camera: PLEASE UPDATE THE PHONE AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE IT. The camera performance improved a by a lot with the latest android patch/update. Camera photos are really good. The photos tend to be on a Colder side so either use pro mode or put on a warm builtin filter. With the latest update these issues are mostly resolved. The main Camera is of 48MP and it's really good in outdoor settings but it struggles a bit indoors. Low light photos are good. The good feature of this camera is it scales down 48MP to 12MP (i.e. there is same amount of information in 48MP and 12MP picture) thus increasing the vividness of the image, this allows it to take excellent phones even in low light condition. Wide angle camera is also very good. Depth sensor does it's work very well and edge detection in the image is also done well so that only background objects are blurred. This phone comes with a built-in Digital Signal Processor for image processing tasks such as edge detection, scenery detection, face detection etc. This DSP is not available even in exynos 9610 processor of Samsung A50. Battery: Battery is a #GoMonster Feature of this phone: 6000mah. This is about 50% more than common smartphone batteries of 4000mah. This phone lasted me a around 2 days from 100 to 1 percent, with 3-4 hours of music and video streaming. You can be assured that the phone won't run out of charge at the end of day one. There is a 15 Watt charger (Samsung Adaptive Fast Charger) provided in the box. It takes around 2.5 to 3 hours to charge the phone completely. (Older phones used to come with 10Watt charger. this charger is also 50%-40% faster than normal chargers) Software: One UI (Samsung's User interface on top of android) is really good and doesn't have any bugs. The performance is fast, ram management is good. Because of 6 GB ram, many apps are cached in ram according to usage patterns so there is no lag in opening apps. There is some mild bloatware which can be uninstalled or disabled. Keep in mind there are very less Google apps preinstalled as Samsung is trying to reduce it's dependence on android. Microsoft Office Suite is preinstalled (It can be uninstalled/disabled). Apps get installed quickly. around 108GB internal storage is available to install apps. Samsung also provides a functionality to move app data to SD card to free up internal storage. Performance: The processor is very snappy. it gives 145256 in AnTuTu benchmark. The processor is made with 10nm Semiconductor size which reduces it's battery consumption, further improving battery life. Gaming performance is not stellar but it's good. The GPU of Samsung processors have never been as good as Snapdragon processors, but it's above average. Arcade games like Limbo, Badland, Brawl Stars work great without any lags. * Overall I would say go for this phone over A50, A50s, Mi A3."

137585,mobile,"If you are looking for a good earphone in this price range, this is one option worth considering. Its been a month since I started using these and I'm satisfied as of now. So the first look of the product wasn't great, it looks like some fake Chinese earphones. But once plugged in, it's a beast. So performance wise, this is one of the best you will find in the range. Now it depends on your preference what you want to value more. A quick Summary: Bass: 9/10 Treble: 9/10 Vocals: 8/10 Outside Noise Reduction: 8/10 Microphone quality: 9/10 Comfort: 9/10 Build Quality: 8/10 Looks: 7/10 Overall Performance: 9/10 Overall appearance: 7.5/10 Decision: Your call what you value more. Appearance wise, you may find better looking earphones in the price range. But if you re indifferent to how they look and focus is more on performance, then these are on of the best you will find. P.S.: They entangle like any other earphone. No innovation on this end. :)"

With this 4k stick I finally managed to get 4k and UHD. I have my own personal live tv app (which I am not going to disclose) working smoothly. You can also install jio tv if you want. I also got echo which is working fine with the fire stick. Tv volume and power synced but mute is not working.

AMAZON don't take any responsibility, if your gadget is not work properly or any defect is there is your device. This phone has very less sound and phone got cut again and again. Phone does not catch network properly. I gifted this phone to my dad, it was a great spoiler. Don't buy Gadgets from amazon. Now amazon is saying they don't accept return for mobile phones and they don't even replace with the same piece. Replacement of an electronic gadget is not there in their policy. The phone has very less sound, network is not catching, very pathetic phone. And when I told these problem to amazon, they said according to their policy this is not a problem. I am not able to make phone calls because of less sound and poor network catching ability of the phone, but amazon said this is not even a problem for them. Very pathetic service actually no service by AMAZOM. I am thinking of putting case against amazon on consumer court regarding this issue."

133382,mobile,"Honestly I am a samsung fan starting from my samsung galaxy star pro then Samsung galaxy j2 pro and now Samsung M30s. All its phone have superb quality. Samsung M30s is one of the best phone of samsung series. It has wonderful super amoled display, awesome camera of 48megapixel,wonderful performance. Camera quality is awesome. It has the best clarity.Battery life is long lasting , it last for around 2days. But if more game is played then it lasts for atleast 1day ie 23-24hours not more than that.The fingerprint reader is also good but sometimes it's not fast as compared to others. But there is one problem,when the phone usage is high it gets heated which is quite dissatisfying. Rest everything is fine."

161623,mobile accessories,"Using this phone since January, as a long iPhone user I love it. Still it's ridiculously costly & Apple doesn't provide you with fast charge with this! It is just baffling how they take customers for granted nowadays. Steve Jobs if somehow come backs to life, he would fire more than half people at Apple. That's how poorly this company has been led after his death."

157644,mobile accessories,"The headphone looked awesome over the internet. It looks grey physically too... But it has the worst performance of any headphones that I have used. First of all, it does not connect properly to phones. It takes a lot of time to get discovered. Sound quality is ok, but when listening to music, clarity is not there at all. JBL or Skull candy is far far better than this. Even when connected, when I am receiving a call, it is making some robotic sound, hence the voice of the caller is not at all clear. Initially I thought it may be due to low charge or network congestion. But even with a full charge and strong network it does that. The mouthpiece is also of a very poor quality. People complain that they are unable to hear my voice, when in reality I am literally shouting at this end. Also the ear buds are uncomfortable. So all in all, please refrain yourself from buying this crap. Instead go for any other headphones."
124030,mobile accessories,"Fingerprint sensor comparison with my J7 pro is very good, and the most love thing is its extended battery of 5000 mAh. But its processing bothers me while multi-tasking it hangs up. And its heating is also an issue compared to my J7 pro"

149195,smartTv,"Osm Me I have been using it for a month, it is very good,"
110503,mobile,"A battery hog, I didn't get a lot of battery life after doing what all you would be doing with your high end device. True, battery life depends on a person's screen time but just imagine, after paying so much and all this iOS app optimization, still device gets heated and battery gets drained very quickly while playing COD @ 60 FPS. Oneplus (a different league, android and Oxygen OS) offers a lot better performance. Battery drain also happens whole running YouTube app. Even on Safari, watch HD videos and you will see 1-2% drop per minute if not more. Putting this all into perspective. This isn't an ergonomic device for someone who has a lot of expectations from a budget iPhone (LOL, I 'm using the term budget, seems ironic). Secondly, the viewing experience in a 50k worth device matters the most. What's good if you have so nice hardware but the Display is not so nice? Here I wud like to say, that this device's display was a bummer. Coming from iPhone X, I was totally disappointed that you are paying 50k but not getting a proper OLED display, it's all but LCD - Retina, they call it. Totally crap. The contrast is too poor to call it a premium display coz even midrange displays give you a better experience. A12 sucks, SDs are topping the charts!!! Lastly, should you buy it? FFS, no. XR depreciated 27k, first time in history of iPhones, a device has seen so much depreciation in the first year itself. So, think twice. The display and overall performance seemed at par with most budget mid range devices. But if you are only cared about the Notch and Apple logo - go for it blindly (and maybe regret later)."
112933,smartTv,"Apple is always good, this is my 2nd iphone this year from amazon and delivery was quite on tine"
155921,refrigerator,Super....
147950,mobile accessories,"Nothing to like. Worst product, not worth to buy even for RS. 500. If you really care about review don't buy this product. Stopped working in 1 month. Worst battery backup. Worst quality product nothing good."

119223,mobile,Camera poor battery good
140553,mobile,Its front camera is awesome but back camera is average performer. Its helio P70 processor performance is superb. We can play games under high graphics due to this processor. Battery life is little below average. Sound quality is good. Color OS is performing better than I expected. Overall it is a good deal for its price. 3gb ram 32 gb storage is enough for an ordinary user. We can also extend memory by external memory card.

149516,smartTv,Overall device is fine... But camera quality is so bad that it is worse than my old device Redmi 4. Selfie camera is like a 5 MP camera on my another Samsung phone. Photos of people on Redmi y2 look so much artificial. Colours look so much different than real on both front & rear Cameras. Camera of this device disappointed me otherwise device is fine. If your interest is not a camera centric device then only buy else go for other options. üìåMost important point.... This phone have 32bit os instead of 64bit search this on Google!
137639,mobile,"If you have used wide screen phone before buying this phone, it will be bit difficult to typing text in this phone. Coming to camera, picture will be blurred if you take snap of little moving object also."
111422,mobile accessories,"After use of 10 days i have fallen in love with it. Loved it all the way best processor, best camera, playing pubg at least 4 hrs still the device doesn't heats up. Like the gpu turbo feature & n latest updates üòçüòç after pie update the phn is on fireü§©ü§©."

137590,mobile,If you are looking for an iPhone and your budget is around 50k-60k then you should definitely go with iPhone XR. It is the value for money iPhone. I've been using it for the past 3 days and I am really happy with its performance.
159920,mobile,This is something our generation needs the most The broken or tangled charging cables are the main issue faced by us Well this cable is absolutely for you With good strength durability and turbo charging mode
140547,smartTv,"Its fine, @ 42k its disappoiting why company omit backlid led keyboard. Licensed ms office ( outlook not bundled ) Pen funtionality is not so great. Also mouse pad has a creaking noise. I made 2 attempt for replacement but no one processed my request."

132303,smartTv,"Great product and worth the money paid, good HD quality screen and voice clarity. Super smart TV for such less price is a good value."
140507,mobile,Its been one week since i bought it. I am completely satisfied with the product. Screen is quite big. Only and only problem is with the Charger. It takes 3 hours to charge the phone to 100%. Otherwise everything else is worth the price we are paying.
154750,mobile,Sometime‚Äôs it‚Äôs earpiece speaker not working.
118909,mobile accessories,Camera and video quality is very bad
144906,mobile accessories,"Nice design, battery life and good performance. Stock android which is always a plus point. Fast booting. Out Of Box headphone design is pathetic. Can't use that. Speaker of this phone is very low."
153691,mobile,"Samsung M30s is a budget phone. But it disappointed me. Front and Rear camera's picture quality is too bad, so much noisy picture captured it, even you zoom it , you didn't see clearly. Video quality good, but there is also noisy. When captured with 48mp option, it take long time to save the picture,even slow motion video take long to save.If you connect your phone with WiFi and saw movie or playing games then 6000mah will be short for 1day lasting; otherwise it will back up your phone for 40-50 hours for normal usage, only take calls,chats, taking pictures etc etc. Display quality superb, online content watching in this phone awesome. Samsung must improve or fixed camera quality by software update, otherwise it does not sell in future."
134820,mobile accessories,"I got it Rs.21,000 on offer. Picture quality was awesome. Sound quality is good. we can a one day battery life with normal usage on a single charge.I am completely satisfied with the product. I love this one from Apple‚ù§Ô∏è"
170052,mobile accessories,"the device leaves a lasting impression as a capable all-round offering that doesn‚Äôt compromise on essentials. While the design could‚Äôve been refined further, the handset has a gorgeous display, impressive cameras, reliable hardware, and a battery that‚Äôs miles ahead of its rivals. Hardware and software CPU: Quad core, 2.3 GHz + Quad cor‚Ä¶GPU: Mali-G72 MP3RAM: 4 GBMemory: 64 GB + Up to 512 GBSIM Slots: Dual SIM , GSM+GSMBattery: 6000 mAH Instead of talking about Samsung Galaxy M30s‚Äô design, we‚Äôll start this review with its innards. That‚Äôs because it has got some serious upgrades. The calling card of course, is its 6,000mAh battery ‚Äì which hasn‚Äôt been seen on a mainstream smartphone yet, especially at this price point (there‚Äôs ROG Phone II as well, though one could argue that it‚Äôs focused on the gaming niche). And if the 5,000mAh pack on its predecessor managed to impress us, imagine how good the battery life on the M30s would be. Well, I tested out the phone as a daily driver and didn‚Äôt need to charge it before the end of two days. And this is when I used it extensively for battery-guzzling tasks like navigation and as a hotspot, along with streaming videos and podcasts, web surfing and checking email. In PCMark10‚Äôs battery test, the device scored 20 hours, which is impressive indeed. And if you‚Äôre worried about putting the device on charge overnight as it‚Äôd take a long time to juice up, then don‚Äôt. Thanks to 15W charging support, it goes from 10 to 100 percent levels in about two hours. From my point of view though, maybe the brand should‚Äôve opted for higher wattage, making charging it even faster. While the M30 made use of Samsung‚Äôs new Exynos 7809 SoC, the Galaxy M30s gets an upgrade in the form of the octa-core Exynos 9611 chipset. The 10nm silicon offers two quad-core clusters of Cortex-A73 and Cortex-A53 running at 2.3GHz and 1.7GHz, respectively. To see how improved it is over the chip powering the device‚Äôs previous iteration, While the Galaxy M30s is better than the M30, it isn‚Äôt the fastest phone in town. Having said that, it does manage to hold its own. More importantly, I didn‚Äôt face any trace of lag while using it on a day-to-day basis. Multitasking is smooth as well, all thanks to 6 gigs of RAM. The Exynos 9611 SoC comes with Mali-G72 MP3 graphics which are able to handle gaming relatively well. Playing Asphalt 9 or PUBG Mobile was a joyous affair, though there were certain instances of frame drops. And it‚Äôs worth noting that the device is able to play PUBG at the highest graphics settings, and if you choose the lower one, then the experience is much smoother. In terms of thermal efficiency, the device is quite good and heats up only a bit when it‚Äôs pushed to the limits. Taking care of storage needs on the M30s is 128GB of built-in memory, which offers around 110GB to you out of the box. If need be, it can be topped up with the use of a microSD card. Since the phone has triple slots, you don‚Äôt need to sacrifice on the dual-SIM capabilities either. The phone ships with Android 9.0 Pie which is layered with OneUI. We already love this minimalistic interface and its features such as dark mode, though have to point out that there‚Äôs still some bloatware preinstalled and you do get unnecessary notifications from the MyGalaxy app. Despite sporting a single speaker at the bottom, the audio output on the Galaxy M30s is quite loud. It‚Äôs not really rich however, and the fact that the sound gets muffled when you are holding the device in the landscape position is also a bummer. Cameras Primary camera: 48 MPFlash: LED FlashSecondary camera: 16 MP Similar to its previous avatar, Samsung‚Äôs new Galaxy M30s flaunts a trio of sensors on its back. However, the primary camera gets an upgrade as it comes with a 48-megapixel sensor instead of a 16MP shooter. Pros Astounding battery life Packs a massive cell without being bulky or unwieldy Great shooting capabilities Smooth performance Immersive Super AMOLED display Cons Night mode isn‚Äôt the best Selfie shooter could‚Äôve been better No display protection."

134413,smartTv,"I bought this product on 24th Dec 2018(I bought this at Rs. 11,490.00) after reading so many reviews and researching other tv's at this price range. Below are my Reviews after 2days of usage..., 1. Picture quality is good even for SD channels(Comparatively better than MI in this price range). 2. Sound quality is not that great but ok(satisfied). 3. Web touch remote is really great option(Through E-share App., Using Remote control from Mobile) . 4. By default it has apps like hotstar, youtube, facebook and netflix. Connecting to wifi is easy and there is no issue till now. 5.Jio TV is also working fine ., Cons: 1. Casting(M-Cast and normal cast) is won't work with all the mobile devices. I have LYF which can't be connected to this TV but Lenova mobiles are connecting easily. But it has Eshare which will connect your phone and TV and you have to install app in the phone. Note: They won't provide batteries for the remote. Overall, it's good product at this price range.

Love Samsung n Lenovo both.My fourth tab after Asus,Swipe,Mi Pad. Nobody ran a year. Finally I decided to go for the best brand (not as great as Samsung but they're way too costly) and sealed the deal here at Amazon looking at the specs. Latest android Nougat, Snapdragon 625 Octacore, and 4 GB RAM which no other tab under 22K provides. This is my 6 the day and it has fulfilled all my basic tab needs without any lags.Awesome interface, fast loading,sharp crystal clear hd display. Rest features you can read. Main USP is that it is extremely light weight ,very hand.Quite attractive glass finish which gives it a premium look."

Watching movies or listening to music, these have been great for everyday use with my phone and laptop both."
157527,mobile,"The display and picture quality is amazing.. 6gb ram ensures the phone is super smooth. Totally worth it . There are downsides as well (what i felt) 1) 3.5 mm jack missing.. we have to use a c-type to 3.5mm adaptor (included in d box) to connect normal headphones. In case if you forget to carry the adaptor, you cant connect it to aux or connect headphones. 2) does not support memory card. In case if you have data from your previous phone on a memory card, you cannot mount it directly on the phone. Overall.. a superb phone."
121050,mobile,"Don't think twice, just pick this powerbank. Best point, they don't stop u at airport for carrying this, because it is not a local made powerbank. In terms of specs, it's quality is unmatched."

120950,mobile accessories,"Don't buy this phone. One of the worst phone. My sis asked some phone to buy. I suggested this phone beavuse of Samsung name. That's why I didn't suggest other phones. But I ditched her hard earned money. Worst battery, heavy, touch response is not good, camera is worst."
160412,mobile accessories,This phone is very good in all angles.
122200,mobile accessories,"Excellent 25 MP front camera ,excellent display, excellent camera quality, tow day battery life for normal use or other use one-day, fringerprint lock work quick, face lock work quick, but excellent smartphone"
113275,smartTv,At this price point the phone is just average. Definitely not bang for your buck. Phone does have a lot of bugs and the touch is not that responsive. Adding a 1000 ‚Çπ to your budget will get you a better smartphone. And camera is definitely a let down. Photos taken are definitely bad as ever. Redmi 4 had a 2.0 aperture which took better photos than note 4 and redmi 7. This one has a f/2.2 aperture which at this price point just aint worth. Buy only as a spare phone.
166386,mobile accessories,"Worth every penny and about the camera well use your brains, play store have apps so henceforth... Value for money"
166850,mobile accessories,"Xiaomi Redmi 5 worth for money, actually it is very compact and lightweighted than Note5. Redmi 5 is lighter than note5 and easily slip in pocket. Battery life is also good enough for day."

128858,smartTv,"Good one. Ram specs are a bit misleading . Though ram provided is 2666MHz , it runs at max frequency of 2400MHz which I think is due to the fact that Ryzen 5 3550h supports max Ram Frequency of 2400MHz. My piece doesn't heat up much but yes,fan noise is extreme. Bios is very amateur, literally of no use. But for the price , can't expect much."

143080,mobile accessories,Monster battery as promised by samsung and fingerprint reader is quick. Camera too is good but it is taking a second to adjust the focus and steady mode is absent in 4K recordings.S-AMOLED diplay is a treat to watch. The colours are vibrant and the clarity is wonderful. Processor is optimised for gaming and the complimentary battery life adds on to the continuous gaming without lag. Overall the best smart phone to buy in the mid segment price range.
169834,books,satisfied
133304,mobile accessories,"High end phone in a reasonable range, camera quality and touch is great. Battery backup and power charging are a life saver. Best thing is the processor ,which was only used in Samsung's expensive products is provided in Galaxy M30s at rs13999. Face recognition is apt. Go for it, it's a top notch phone at a very reasonable price for its features and functions"

153496,mobile,"Review of #GalaxyM30s after 7 days of intense usage. (4GB ram / 64 GB) Pros :- 1. Super Amolate display - Frankly speaking the display is very good & it is literally spoiling me. 2. User Interface - Its very simple and easy, far better than the Color OS in Realme / Vivo. 3. Battery Backup - There is no competition available in the market in terms of battery life. Excellent! 4. RAM Management - Pretty Good (I ain't a hardcore gamer, so it might be different for others) but for me as an everyday rigorous user its pretty good. 5. Cellular Network - I have used 3 Sim card (JIO, Vodafone & Airtel) and all 3 of them worked perfectly. 6. Sound Quality - Very good and with headphones it's even better because of Dolby Atmos. 7. Processor - Its pretty good and the phone didn't lag a bit (till dated) and nor was there any heating issue. 8. Fingerprint Scanner - It takes roughly 4-5 second to unlock or even less. Cons - 1. Camera - you will be disappointed if you are highly optimistic about the camera of the phone. The Color saturation of the back camera if good and looks clean but as soon as you zoom in it divides into grains. Coming back to the front camera, it's not good. It kind of gives a artificial soft skin (which I didn't like personally). The portrait and panorama mode are decent. Overall the camera is AVERAGE, not the best. 2. In box accessories - In the box you won't be getting a headphone or a back cover or a screen protector."

134099,mobile accessories,"I bought I phone 7 from Reliance Digital and I must say I am very disappointed with the product and its after sales service as the phone has some serious heating issues specially if you are multitasking, such as charging and connecting to hotspot at the same time.I bought this issue to Apple care and Reliance Digital guys notice, but no body is accepting that it is an issue after keeping my phone with them for more then a month. Even there are lags while operating the phone. After investing almost 60 K if this is the kind of experience you get out of your purchase its very sad and sickening. Looks like I phone 7 got some issues but manufacturers are trying to hide to keep their success story running. DO NOT GO FOR IT."

118500,smartTv,"Box contains: - Handset - 10 watt charger - USB Cable - Sim Insertion tool - Back cover - User Guide Pros: - BATTERY LIFE (5/5): 4000 mAh: The biggest advantage of a Xiaomi is always its battery performance, in moderate use it will easily last for a day, In light usage, it lasts over a day and half. 7-8 hrs on high usage. To charge from 0-100, it takes 2:20 hrs time. -PERFORMANCE (4/5): Snapdragon 632 Processor: Before this, on REDMI series SoC's were not that powerful, mostly using 4XX series, but now performance of SD 632 is good. - CAMERA (4/5): 12MP+2MP Dual Rear camera: which clicks quite good pictures. 8 MP Front Camera: Edge detection is good. Camera2api support. - IR Blaster which can be used as a remote for A/C, TV etc. - Dedicated SD card slot so you can have two sim cards and a sd card, but in the Redmi Note 7 it is a hybrid slot and you will have to settle for one sim card + sd card - Gorilla Glass 5 -LED notification near the charging port - Dual VoLTE. - Fingerprint reader is fast & responsive. - Face unlock works pretty well - The back with Red & Blue shades look pretty good - Extra features of the Mi Operating system Cons: - few high performance apps tends to crash so always prefer the 3GB RAM version. - Under direct sunlight, screen visibility is very low - Screen is HD+ 720p. Not Full HD. - Plastic body. - No EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization). - Still, Redmi 7 is good device If you are tight on budget, it is an absolute deal with value for money. Also most suitable phone if you're going to gift it for your loved ones like your parents. But If you are a considerably heavy user of mobile & can spend some more money,You should go for Redmi Note 7, Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, or Realme 3. --------------------------------------- Hope my review Helped you"

131425,mobile accessories,"Got my M30s and overall happy to have a good phone from Samsung. Performance wise and battery life its really amazing and do delivers what Samsung is committing. After using it for around 15 days, here are my Pros and Cons for this phone based on my experience: PROS: 1) Very Good Battery Life (almost lasts for 2 days with regular usage). 2) Performance is really great. 3) No Heating or lagging issue at all. 4) Display is Top notch as always with Super Amoled HD+ and definitely it is far better than any other brand phones available at this price range. 5) Also has ""Always on Display"" feature which gives us a feeling of having any of the Flagship phone. 6) Super Slo-mo and Slo-mo features in Camera are also very Good and records really great videos. 7) Hyper-laps & Super-steady Mode feature are also working nicely. 8) Fingerprint reader is also working fine. CONS: 1) Build Quality is bit disappointing. 2) Camera quality which is one of the Big Highlights of this is not up to the mark. Specially the Front camera of 16MP is giving Bad results. 3) Rear Camera is also very Average. Specially in low light conditions it gives you very bad images. Samsung should seriously look into this matter and should update the its Camera performance. 4) Samsung should also provides either Case cover or headphones along inside the box but both things are not available with this. Over all in this price range, i would say its a Decent phone with many good features but definitely disappoints in the Camera department which Samsung should consider on priority basis and improve via OTA update."

148623,mobile accessories,On time delivery . Loved it
134541,mobile accessories,I decided to go with this phone mainly because I read about the low SAR value of it. Other than that I think this is not worth the price. Some issues I noticed after consistent use over last more than a week; 1. Absolutely poor response to touch. Precise also seems to be poor. 2. Battery life is also not as expected from this 4000mAh piece. 3. Apps are sluggish on this phone in comparison to even a 1.5GB ram phone. Overall I think it is not worth it.
137435,mobile accessories,"I've used this phone for a while now and is working fine.. no lag.. games running well.. camera quality is good enough.. if you don't want to spend more than 15K, I feel this is good choice.."

The only feature I may frankly complain about is the sound, which is not up to the mark, as compared to it's vivid picture and color quality...At present I am using the external audio amplifier with external speakers ro get a richer sound output. May be Sony should have also provided one more HDMI port for connection to home DVD players, or other such devices.On the whole I am a satisfied customer for having bought this TV."

The company doesn't take any responsibility for the quality of surface finish that the phone has. There are quite a lot of users worldwide facing the same issue but the company has turned a blind eye to it. Shame that a company like Apple would do this to its customers. One expects a certain level of quality while purchasing a phone worth 50000 bucks."

118397,smartTv,Bought it from somewhere else. But faced issue with the product so thought of letting everyone know. This product had battery problem. Initially it given very good battery but within a year the battery backup drops to less than 30 min. Which is not good for a device which costs 8K. If you check the reviews on other websites you will see that most of the users are facing the same issue. So my advice is STAY AWAY.
135212,refrigerator,I have been using this watch for almost 2 years from now. No cons so far. In fact I had bought it from Dubai
118403,mobile,Bought it on April 14. So far it's working well. I'm a heavy user. So battery life is some what ok. Upto 20 hours I can use it before charging again. Like the fingerprint unlock like. It's very fast. Saves me the hassle of manually unlocking. It has a little bit heating problem when charging or using it for long time. Other than everthing is good. Phone speed is really good. Worthy for the amount spent.

I am not a professional reviewer but I have used many different mobiles in the past and first time, I have tried first time Huawei company Mobile and I am quite lucky to say that my decesion was excellent. Pros - 1.both back and front pop cameras are superb even better than my last mi A2 phone. Photos are crisp clear and 'n' number of options are available. These ""n"" numbers are touching professional modes as well. If you are youtuber, videos are of professional quality and it shoots object focus in a perfect manners in video mode. *only drawback is that it can not shoot 4k videos, although available options are worth to shoot good quality videos. 2.Octacore 710 processor is very fast to perform multiple applications and gaming is smooth and no heating as well. 3.Screen response and touch is very responsive. Bright IPS HD+ screen is equivalent to amoled screen. Anyways it is excellent for all purposes. 4.Battery 4000Mah is good enough to run mobile one complete day with using 02 hours gaming, 05 hours music and video and other applications. If you don't use other heavy gaming etc, it can run 2.5 days easily.C type charger is bonus. It takes approximately 1.5 hours to charge 0 to 100. Cons Not find till date, update you soon"

138072,mobile,Internet Connectivity is a little bit slow. Not sure whether the problem is with phone or with the ISP
167949,smartTv,good
110738,mobile,"A massive battery easily ensures two and a half days of moderate usage. The camera gives sharp pictures in good lighting conditions. In the dark, the night mode without flash gives artistic images with shadows. However, the camera takes a long time for the exposure and one needs to keep the phone absolutely still. If we use the flash, the images are relatively clear. The sAMOLED display is a delight and easy on the eyes - one of the hallmarks of this smartphone. The Dolby Atmos sound works with earphones / headphones but not with the speakers. The opal black colour is also something I liked. However, a major irritant is that the Galaxy Store apps get downloaded even if I don't need them. I keep deleting those apps and they keep getting downloaded."
137655,smartTv,If you use it on high volume it will be discharged in 10 -12 minutes other wish sound quality is great

OnePlus 7t phone is very good, it is very good, its camera quality is also very good and what is the enjoyment of the Oxygen OS, so the phone is very good overall, there is no shortage in this, I had the desire to complete this phone The Amazon delivery service worst too much delay These phones were purchased in the Amazon Great Indian Festival. All these fine ok the phone is very good I'm very happy. Very disappointed for one thing Audio Jack not available in the phone No worry OnePlus was found in the name of the Flagship Killer when you came to Market Now oneplus's own flagship phone come to the market. At least in Apple's XR include ear buds in the box for free You had to take some Option to For the Earphone While you are charging a Flagship phone price, but you are not giving us the complete accessories. Above all you are competing with Apple and Samsung. At least Apple gives full accessories in exchange for the price it takes. I think oneplus have to provide complete accessories in the box."

147960,mobile,"Nothing to say it's a cheap ""PIXEL"" phone. Excellent camera and best Android experience."
110162,mobile,1. Camera: quality ( 48mp) is so good . But taking photos by using 48mp camera it takes time to save the image. If you want quick clicks or action pictures you can avoid this option and choose other camera options 2. Battery: Earlier I was using 3300Mah battery phone the charge was coming around 7-8hrs . For office I use to bring chargers or power banks . Now this one coming around 14hrs . This made me so comfortable. 3.Display: looks so good looks like high range phones. Cons: The body of the camera is glassy. It's slippery. They didn't provide any ear phone. Request: while launching new phones please add basic phone case it will be helpful because it takes time to get cases from market.
110123,smartTv,1) Bluetooth connectivity - It works around 12 feet range and it automatically gets disconnected if you go beyond that range. 2) Portablility - 10/10 3) Sound Quality - It's louder but if the sound of the video or the audio is low it doesn't enhance it. In that case it's bit low. And there is a slight vibration when the device is in full volume. But other than that it's just cool and louder.

115696,smartTv,Battery issue. Lasts only 8 hrs. Apple and Amazon website declares 13 hrs of LTE usage. But Apple service centre rejected it and said 8 hrs is the normal life of an iPhone. You have to charge 3 times in a day. Irritating. Amazon have no return policy for the device complaint. You have to approach Apple care only.

136439,mobile,I ordered this app in Feb 2019. Phone is very good in built quality. No hang. No heating. No charges on free app mostly usable. Great Camera quality. Good screen resolution. Strong aluminium body. Good and strong SIM TRAY Great sound quality in Apple Headphones Loved. Good quality charging cum usb cable and charger. The only shortcoming is only Battery Backup. So keep Battery Bank with you. Average battery life is one day for calling if you off the data. In data mode only rest for 5 hours. Over all value for money. And do purchase and use it.
160694,smartTv,"This review is for 43"". None of backlight issues and other picture quality issue mentioned in other reviews (mostly 55"") are present. The picture quality is absolutely fabulous. Initially i was worried that SD channels may not be good. Rest assured, the picture clarity and motion smoothness is very good. Needless to mention that FHD and 4k movies played by in built amazon prime app is awesome. Reducing brightness and enabling ambient light sensor helps comfortable viewing. The builtin picture setting are also effective and useful. Recently an firmware update was pushed. This adds capiblity for smart hub (alexa/google) control. Bluetooth, screen mirroring worked very well. Setting up was easy. One point, i had to disable client isolation in my router for screen mirroring and remote control android app to work. Sound quality is balanced. TV has optical out and hdmi arc to connect to external amplifier. For now, I am happy with built in speakers. The installation experience in bangalore was pleasant. Installation was done same day itself . Overall a very good 4k tv with all the required features."

160195,mobile,"This mobile looks like a 20 or 25K costs phone. Key features are as follows 1. Mobile's battery life is good. Running a minimum of 24 hours after a full charge. 2. Camera quality is superfine (comparative with similar range mobiles) 3. The look is awesome. 4. The screen is very sensitive and fragile. 5. After three or four months, the processor gets a little bit slow but does not hang. 6. The fingerprint sensor works super fine for the first two months, after that, it also gets slow. Overall a good mobile in this range. Do not expect too much in below 13K INRs. Just accept one thing that ""Itne Mein Itna Hi Milta hai"" ;)"

Display is super Battery life is really appreciable, it lasts 1 and half day with moderate usage and 1 day with heavy usage. Camera performance is awesome in good lighting condition Finger print and face unlock works very fine. The only thing i m not happy is the second space does not work well. The hold and the built quality is superb. Its so handy that u ll fall in love with it. Due to its cat6 modem the network quality is awesome. Overall you can easily buy it at 10k range . You will love it. Only thing i m worried is whether it will get proper updates or not. Neways thanks amazon for the offer and MI for the beautiful phone."

112920,smartTv,"Apple iPhone is now in its ninth year with the iPhone 7 / 7 Plus. With just a year to go for the big 10th anniversary, Apple seems to be saving some goodies for the next year. I will get to that in a bit. Launched in India on 7 October with prices starting from Rs 60,000 and going all the way to Rs 92,000, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have arrived in India quite soon after their international launch. With Diwali just around the corner, and its arch-rival Samsung pulling out its flagship Note 7 after the unfortunate battery burning issues, the field is wide open for Apple iPhone 7 / 7 Plus to make a killing. Or is it? Let us find out Build and Design: 8/10..... The iPhone 7 Plus does not come with a drastically new design. You can look at it more of adding finesse to the iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus designs. The similar design is now in its third generation. Is Apple holding out till next year, to release a brand new design language? Not that it is bad in the current state, but it dosen't make it stand out from its predecessors. Not to mention, the designs from its Android arch-rivals has certainly seen changes over the years. The first thing that you will notice when you handle the phone, is that the visible antenna lines have been nicely camouflaged. While it is still visible to an extent on the Rose Gold, Silver and Gold variants of the phone; on the Matte Black and Jet Black versions, you have to really look for it. The rounded edges, power / standby, volume rocker buttons and the ringer notch are all in the same spot as the iPhone 6s Plus. So is the home button. But there‚Äôs a catch. The circular button isn‚Äôt a push button anymore but is supported by the Taptic Engine's feedback mechanism. The Taptic Engine which supports the 3D touch mechanism for the display, also controls the touch response on the button. You can set the levels of feedback for the button, and honestly after a while you forget that the button isn‚Äôt there. It is one cool implementation. And it is such fine design details that make Apple products what they are. The edges are 7.3mm thick and it weighs around 188 grams. While the thickness is the same as its predecessor, it is around 4 grams lighter. In terms of overall feel of the phone and sturdiness, there isn‚Äôt much different from the iPhone 6s Plus. And the complaint we had with the 6s Plus remains. The iPhone 7 Plus offers a terrible body to screen ratio as compared to some of its Android flagships such as the Galaxy S7 edge or the newly launched Google Pixel XL, which offers 5.5-inch display in a more compact body. The rear side has a bump in the top left hand corner which houses two 12MP camera sensors. Snapping on cover on the iPhone brings the camera bump with the plane of the iPhone back. There is one important addition though. It is IP67 certified which makes it water and dust resistant. Metal back is still as slippery as its predecessors. Apple has some really cool leather covers with metallic button areas if you have buttery hands. They sell separately, of course. Snapping them on further reduces ease of one-handed use. And no, you cannot use the last generation covers on this phone for obvious reasons. I got the matte black variant to review, and it looks quite wonderful, as compared to the other three colours. The Jet Black variant is still the more premium variant, and I would not be surprised if we see more Jet black or piano black phone colours over the coming months. Features: 8.5/10 Thanks to a limited product portfolio in its smartphone segment, Apple really ensures that the internals get a good amount of upgrade in the coming generations. To that extent, the iPhone 7 Plus comes with the Apple A10 Fusion chipset which has a quad-core processor clocked at 2.23GHz. This is paired with 3GB RAM. It comes with a 5.5-inch Full HD resolution display. There are three storage variants - 32GB, 128GB and 256GB of which we have the 256GB variant for review. There is no expandable storage. It runs on iOS 10. A single nano SIM card slot is present on the right hand side, just below the power/standby button. It supports dual band Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, Wi-fi hotspot, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS with A-GPS and GLONASS, NFC only for Apply Pay which is not available in India. And also, no FM radio. The big changes on the features front is the dropping of the 3.5mm audio jack. You will need a lightning port connector on your earphones. Apple bundles a pair. Other option is using a Bluetooth headset to enjoy your music. Apple has also bundled in a lightning port to 3.5 mm audio jack adapter for those who still want to rely on their personal audio gear. This is one move that drew a lot of flak as a lot of us still prefer using personal earphones / headphones which still have a 3.5mm jack. But give it some time and you will see a lot more lightning port earphone accessories, going by Apple‚Äôs history of spawning off accessories market segments. The iPhone 7 Plus comes with stereo speakers finally, with one being at the base and the other on the earpiece speaker. On the camera front, you get two 12MP sensors on the back and there is a 7MP front-facing FaceTime HD camera. Apple has implemented the dual rear cameras in a way that you get to use true 2x optical zoom. Display: 8/10 The iPhone 7 Plus sports a 5.5inch FullHD display which gives a pixel density of 401PPI. The panel is an LED backlit IPS LCD panel. However with the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple claims to be using a wide gamut display (cinema standard). When placed side by side with the iPhone 6s/6s Plus, I noticed that the iPhone 7 Plus had a slight warm tinge to it. The iPhone 7 Plus is definitely a notch brighter than the 6s Plus. The Night Shift mode lets you select the time when you want to display to control the blue light, and it also lets you select the shade of yellow that you are comfortable with. This added granularity is a nice touch. Colour reproduction is spot on and it is still a class-leading display among smartphones. Colours aren't unnecessarily vivid. Legibility in sunlight is not an issue, as its auto-brightness mode works quite well. The display, as has been the case with previous generations, is quite glossy. It was while shooting in bright sunlight where at times all I could see on the display was my reflection, specially when shooting from chest height. Not so much at the eye level. The black levels on the display are quite good and watching movies or playing games is a lot of fun. Games such as Vain Glory, Real Racing 3, Nova 3 look gorgeous on this calibrated display. Software: 8/10 Apple iPhone 7 Plus comes with the latest iOS 10 operating system. The one running on the review unit was 10.0.3 on which majority of the testing was done, before switching to the 10.1 beta to access the Portrait mode in the Camera app. The iOS 10 is refined and operationally quite smooth on most occasions. There were a few instances of apps not registering action on first tap. iOS 10 dosen‚Äôt look very different from its predecessor, but packs in a lot of new features. For starters, you can now uninstall the native Apple apps if you don‚Äôt need them. I figured I would do without Stocks, Home and a couple of other apps which I deleted. Technically it just hides the icon and deletes all the app data from your phone. You can reinstall the app by searching for it in the App store. The 3D touch still offers the Peek and Pop features, with support added to a lot more apps than we had seen when the 6s Plus launched. Messages has got a complete revamp with the app letting you add in GIF animations; finger gestures - creating animations such as heart break, beating heart and more; send photos from the camera while in the app; share music and so on. While these additions are playing catch up to the likes of apps such as Telegram, it makes little sense to use Messages if your family or friend circle isn‚Äôt on Apple devices. Control Centre has been modified, with the music control shifted to a new tab. Also the four icons at the base - torch, timer, calculator and camera support 3D gestures, letting you access more functions without leaving the Control Centre screen. iOS 10 also lets you do a lot from the lock screen itself. You can swipe left to open the camera or swipe right to access widgets or swipe from the top to bottom to see notifications. There‚Äôs also the ‚ÄòRaise to Wake up‚Äô feature which wakes up the display when you just lift your iPhone to your face if its lying in the sleep mode on your desk. Music app has got some design changes. Instead of My Music, you now get a Library tab which lets you enlist a variety of options from Playlists, Artists, Album, Songs and so on. You can download songs if you are a subscriber, optimise storage by setting a limit on auto downloads, auto-generated playlists in the 'For You' section and more. The Photos app has got some additions in the form of Memories, where in iOS makes albums based on your photos shot at a particular location. In short, this is Apple Photos playing catch up to Google Photos, which has much more interesting features. Siri was the star feature of the iPhones when it was first announced back in 2011. Since then Google has been getting better with its AI-backed virtual assistant game - first Google Now and this year the Google Assistant. Between the two, we noticed that the Assistant was able to understand accents better and let you have contextual conversations, whereas with Siri you still have to pay attention to your diction. Even asking Siri simple questions such as ""what was the iPhone 7 Plus pricing for India"" or ""when was Siri released?"" the responses weren't very forth coming. Also between the two I also realised that most of the times you have to ask Siri questions in a particular way, and you cannot ask follow up questions and get satisfactory responses as you do with Assistant. Apple says Siri is a self-learning system, so maybe it needs more usage. But after using it for a week, it isn't significantly better than Google Assistant. One thing I would grant Siri is the way it presents card information - is much more richer and informative than Google. Performance: 9/10 Call quality is top notch with audible earpiece speaker even in high traffic situations. The iPhone 7 Plus supports Cat 9 LTE, voice over LTE, Wi-fi calling. I did not find any connectivity issues with a Jio SIM card on it, and was able to make successful VoLTE calls. With the latest Apple A10 Fusion chipset paired with 3GB of RAM (the highest seen on an Apple iPhone) you get a wicked fast device. The A10 Fusion chipset houses a quad-core processor, with two high power cores clocked at 2.23GHz and two low power saving ones. There‚Äôs a six-core GPU as well. The single core performance score of 3445 observed on GeekBench 4 was the highest we have seen on any smartphone we have tested so far. Even the multi-core score is only second to Huawei P9. The AnTuTu benchmark gives 186093 - again the highest score. In terms of raw numbers, the iPhone 7 Plus comes out tops. In real life usage though, the phone runs lag free and things such as app switching, finger print scanning work fast. The phone does get warm when you are on a particularly photography heavy day, but never crossing 36-38 degree mark on the Fluke IR thermometer. Gaming on the phone is smooth. No frame drops were observed on high end games such Vain Glory, Nova 3, Real Racing 3 and so on. Watching movies with the stereo speakers is quite a fine experience. The speakers are quite loud, but in certain applications such as YouTube, we observed that using the headphones was a battery option. Camera: 8.5/10 One of the highlight feature of the iPhone 7 Plus is the presence of the dual rear camera setup. Sure, this isn‚Äôt the first time we are seeing a dual camera on a smartphone. Huawei and LG have done this before. But just like all things Apple, the implementation is different. There are two 12MP sensors, one is standard camera which has an equivalent focal length of 28mm (with an f/1.8 aperture) and the other sensor has a telephoto lens having a 56mm focal length (with an f/2.8 aperture). The standard 28mm lens comes with OIS, whereas the telephoto lens does not. This implementation lets the iPhone 7 Plus offer true 2x optical zoom. The Camera app lets you easily switch regular wide angle shot and the 2x optical zoom shot. This ensures that there is no loss in detail when taking 2x zoom photos. While it may seem like they are two different cameras, they do tend to work together everytime you fire off the shutter. You can use these two lenses when shooting videos as well, but switching to the 2x zoom, will remove the OIS feature. The two lenses work quite well in the Portrait mode which is currently available on the iOS 10.1 beta. Also another thing to note is that the telephoto lens can only be used in well lit situations, and if the light isn‚Äôt enough, the iPhone 7 Plus will use the regular lens with 2x digital zoom. Apple‚Äôs image processor takes this decision on the fly. The iPhone 7 Plus has a 7MP front facing FaceTime HD camera and quad LED flash unit on the rear side. Features carried forward from the iPhone 6s Plus include the live photos, phase detect autofocus. The Camera app is also similar to the one seen in the last generation. Coming to the image quality, the iPhone 7 Plus just like its predecessors, delivers. Colours come out natural and at times it may look a bit too dull when compared with images coming out of say a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge or even the latest Google Pixel XL. Apple iPhone 7 Plus gives a neutral output, with good amount of detail, great dynamic range. Optical zoom works quite well in bright outdoors. You also get the option of using 10x digital zoom for still images and 6x digital zoom for video. Use this only in emergency situations as there is a lot of artifacts you will get in the final images. When forcing the HDR mode, we also noticed some artifacts around the edges if the subject moved too much. Panoramas come out really good, and there is good exposure control. You can also get HDR Panorama shots with the new camera app. There were instances when shooting panoramas in bright sunlight, where I noticed mild change in the sky exposure. But the image stitching is relatively better than that seen on Android phones. The 2x optical zoom also offers Panorama mode. Focussing is relatively quick. But time to first shot is still slow as compared to the quicker ways in which you can turn on cameras in some Android phones. Double tapping the home button to launch the camera is really a no brainer which Apple should implement. Low light image quality is good, but in a side by side comparison with the Google Pixel XL, I noticed that the Pixel XL clearly took the lead there. I‚Äôm not saying iPhone 7 Plus is a bad camera in low light - far from it. But the noise control, detail retention, dynamic range seen on the Galaxy S7 and Pixel XL is notches above the iPhone 7 Plus. The Portrait mode was one area which Apple spoke about a lot during the launch. During the time of testing it was only available on the beta, though it is now available to everyone. Once you turn on the Portrait mode, you will get instructions below the rounded square frame, whether you need to move closer or farther. Once you get the lock, the focussing frame becomes yellow and you fire the shutter. Images clicked in the portrait mode turned out good, it works specially well when you are in a well lit area and there is respectable distance between the subject and the background. The blurring of the background is nicely done and isn't as aggressive as what we have seen with other dual camera phones. The good thing is that you can see the shallow depth of field while you are composing the shot. But the problem is that it will take some practise to get the shot faster. Your subject will have to really be patient till you get everything right. This may be cool when shooting friends and family, but if you are on the street and want to get that quick portrait with a defocussed background, then that can prove difficult. On the video front, the iPhone 7 Plus can shoot up to 4K resolution videos. The OIS on the phone ensures that there is minimal camera shake, although you do see a slight jello effect when walking and shooting. The camera region does get warm when shooting videos. But not enough to cause it to shut down, as I have observed with Sony flagship smartphones. Battery Life: 8/10 Coming with a 2900mAh non-removable battery, the iPhone 7 Plus has seen a bump in this department as compared to the previous generation. In a word, the battery life is excellent. There wasn‚Äôt a day in the two weeks that I was using the phone, when I found the battery to be draining out before my work day. In fact, with a 100 percent charge at 8AM, and after a day of regular usage, I would still have around 20 percent charge remaining till around 10PM. Heavy usage including playing games, streaming video, calling, messaging via multiple apps, using the camera extensively did drain out the battery by around 9PM. The battery usage numbers show some really good numbers with a 16 hour plus usage time and standby time of over 40 hours. It also offers the Low Power mode, which further extends the battery. Charging seems to take forever though. It easily takes over 3 hours to go from sub-10 percent to 100 percent charge. In an age of rapid charging technologies available on all Android flagships, where you can go from 0 to 100 in just over an hour's time, Apple‚Äôs charging technology seems dated. The good thing is that the iPhone 7 Plus can hold the charge for that much longer vis-a-vis an Android phone. But it‚Äôs about time Apple get some sort of quick charging onboard. Is it holding that out for the 10th anniversary edition? If you are still not convinced about the iPhone 7 Plus, or are short on budget, the Android flagships that you can consider include the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge which is still a powerful device. I have been testing the Google Pixel XL for some days now, and it has already shown its capability in the low light department as compared to the iPhone 7 Plus. So that could also be a possible contender."

Bloatware or unnesessary apps can be stopped from getting installed. The Ultra wide camera is great and both the rear setup and front camera provide sharp and good quality pictures. The phone does not lag at all in handling day to day tasks and can also handle multitasking with ease. My review is based on my 2 weeks usage. If you want a phone for taking pictures,watching videos and playing non-heavy duty games,this phone is for you. This combines the specs of Xioami and the Quality and assurance of Samsung."

110761,books,A must have book for all the book enthusiasts out there. Prompt delivery by Amazon and the quality of book is also top notch. I would insist amazon to include bookmarks with all the orders of books made from their site.
161055,mobile accessories,"Total performance of Samsung M 20 is very very bad.Brightness is very poor in both method and hang the phone several times per day. Don,t buy this phone"
142542,mobile,Main camera is very poor... Should give more options in camera
142097,mobile,"Lot of heating issues. If u play song in youtube, do system update or install apps from app store, then phone gets over heated. I called customer support, they told me to install blancco app, so that they can record the temp of mobile. 2 times i called. Both the times, they told me tat there is no heating issue n test is passed. But both the times temp. was 40 degree. According to them 40 degree is not hot. They want more than that. So this is some kind of scam going on with blancco app. So i request customers not to purchase mobile phones from Amazon. They give defective mobiles like this and play with the customers. Because of this we can neither return the handset back nor get the replacement also easily like it used to happen earlier. If there was an option for giving 0 stars i'd have definitely given it. So from now on I'll not buy mobile phones from Amazon. We trust Amazon n buy products here, now when we just want to return or replace the product it is taking so much time n difficulties."

137062,mobile accessories,I was diehard fan of apple and using apple from past 5 year. I got Samsung m30 as a gift and after using this phone after near by 2 months. I will say that Samsung did a good job in mid range phone. camera is best in range and do not compare Samsung with redmi because the robustness which is provided by Samsung is not provided by redmi. second battery life which is 5000mah. My phone runs more than 2 days with one charge with 24hours WiFi. Most important thing I forgot my phone charger at home in a office trip and then I put my phone on energy saving mode and my phone run for 8 days. ENERGY SAVING Mode is not available in any phone in this range. So my final review is this is a must buy phone in this range.
119762,mobile,Charges well and good quality.
150768,mobile,"Phone looks great, easy setup for existing Apple users, camera is impressive with the additional modes. Overall totally satisfied with the purchase detailed review on battery after one month of use will follow."

158956,refrigerator,"There are few points may helpful to find your right band 1. Battery works almost 7-8 days for normal use. 2-3 days on continue heart rate check at an interval of 30mins. 6 hours on excercise mode. 2. Only English font is supported. 3. Sometimes it respond too late almost 3mins late, this is disappointing. 4. Count the step when you travel by bus, bike and car. 5. Band is light weight, scratch resistant and fully waterproof. 6. THE BAND IS PURCHASED A BULK IN INDIA, BUT THE BAND DOES NOT SUPPORT HINDI LANGUAGE. Purchase this if you really need it now, otherwise wait and purchase a smart watch."

134528,smartTv,"I chose the echo dot over the Google home mini as the voice responses from Alexa is much more human sounding than from Google Assistant even though Google offers a lot more functionality and better voice recognition. This is a good device to introduce yourself to home automation. I've kept this device on my bed side table and I use it control my smart lights and a couple of smart switches. *The sound quality is surprisingly good for such a small form factor. However, you should not purchase this if your primary use case is listening to music. *The device is built solidly and has some heft to it. The rubber base ensures that the speaker does not vibrate much. *The ability to create routines is a great convenience. *The wake word detection works well even from a distance of 5 meters. It sometimes fails to register the wake word in the middle of music playback. *The ability to stream music to an external wireless speaker is convenient although the bluetooth range is about 4 meters in direct line of sight. *The voice recognition can be improved a lot more. *Music streaming from sources like Hungama and Gaana are quite buggy and does not often have the music that you're looking for. *Voice recognition often cuts off in the middle of commands. *Alexa finds it necessary to list the names of all the artists in an album before the song, which can be very annoying as some tracks have upwards of 3 artists. *The response from Alexa when the wifi is down is quite long and irritating even if brief mode is enabled. There should be an option to limit it to just a single tone feedback. Unless you plan to have home automation, this device will get quite boring within a span of few days. You can have a much better sounding bluetooth speaker with the added factor of portability for less than half the price (comparing with my boAt stone 650)."

120592,refrigerator,"Disappointed. I am currently using Sony LED HD TV which i bought back in 2017 for 70k. I got this LG UHD Tv delivered today and i bought it for my living room. I am shocked with the picture quality. They call it UHD 4K. How can a company use such terms to sell their products. My Sony TV is not even 4k or UHD. Its a regular HD TV and still far better then this so called LG UHD 4K TV. Do not waste your 60k-65k in this piece of crap. Low quality body, Very very low picture quality. How can someone rate this TV a 5 star. I am sure those reviews are from the seller or the company. I could easily get a 50 inch TV for 35k-50k of other brands like TCL, MI, BPL, Sanyo, Onida, VU etc. There are many other brands who provide TV for a cheaper price but i have spent 62k because i was looking for a good quality product. I could easily get a similar or better picture quality on other local brands. I would suggest everyone to avoid this TV. I have raised a return request and the technician will visit me on 3/4/2019 to inspect. This TV also has a scratch. I hope i will be able to return it. I will update the review after the technician visit."

134891,mobile,"I got the mi a2 about week back. initially the mobile was working fine and the camera quality was really impressive, however I thought of updating the software as it was showing Android pie update available. I updated the mobile to Android pie. thereafter it showed April security patch available for update so I updated for that. but after updating to April April security patch when I restarted the mobile it got stuck at Android one screen and never moved ahead. I tried all kind of tricks and tips but it didn't work. I had to approach Amazon for the replacement. it's really disappointing if a phone get softbricked because all your data that is there in the phone will get destroyed and you lose your important photos videos notes so many other things. so I am really surprised how MI has released the apr security patch without a verifying. there would be two reasons that either the product that is being shipped by Amazon is duplicate or inferior product or me has lost interest in its A2 model and they are just doing the formality of releasing updates without verifying them and in both the cases it will be a disaster to purchase this phone so my advices stay away from this device"

Try to take a picture from what's app directly and from normal camera app at the same place definitely you will find the difference in picture quality. The camera app designed for AI and it's not good. Try to fix this issue realme.

133252,mobile accessories,"Hi guys I am writing this review after usage of 1 month:- 1) DISPLAY :- The most controversial part of this smartphone. But let me tell you this will not disappoint you at all. All the viewing Angels is superb due to AMOLED screen still its HD+ screen you can enjoy videos upto 720p resolution. But I am satisfied with display panel used which is protected by GORRILA GLASS 5. 2). LOOKS :- if you are the person who wants style statement then this phone is perfect to you. It's comapq curved design fits snuggly in hand & also allows you one hand operations with breeze. It will definitely delivers you a premium feeling specially MORE THAN WHITE COLOUR . I am using same and fully satisfied. With front,back & on camera module gorilla glass 5 protection is used so you will feel the premiumness of design. 3). PERFORMANCE :- With Qualcomm snapdragon 665 your day to day task will be smoothly handle by this Smartphone. If you are Pubg lover then you can play on HD graphics on smooth settings. Antutu score of this Chipset is around 140000. So, performance for a moderate user will be upto the mark. The most highlighting aspect of this Smartphone it comes with Android one program. Which helps in fluid performance with superfast updates... 4). BATTERY :- It comes with 4030 mAh battery with fast Charging support of 18watt Charging but out of the box you will receive 10watt charger. I had purchased a 18watt charger & I am completely satisfied with charging speed . It takes 1 hour 40 mins with fast charger to charge the device from 0 to 100%. Not even that it comes with HD+ display and AMOLED panel. So with less resolution of 720p it consumes less battery. So, practically battery life is around 4500mah type.. 5). CAMERA :- No need to worry about it .It's Sony imx 586 sensor which are widely used in flagship Smartphones. In terms of camera 10/10. 6). VERDICT :- If you are watching less videos and playing games not to much then this will perfect pick to u. I was using Full hd Smartphone previously and I shifted to this now but combination of HD+ display with AMOLED is much better than Full hd screen. You should definitely consider this Smartphone. I strongly recommend.."

112704,smartTv,"Amazon screwed up my orders. Bought the device during the preorder period granting me two year extended warranty. A. Amazon failed to honor my warranty during the period of the issue. B. Bought the device thinking it has audible support, turns out Indian devices don‚Äôt support it. Amazon failed to mention this information when I purchase the device. C. Misleading information by the support staff when I tried to get my issue resolved. Over all a poor experience for a stellar device :("
152476,mobile,"Pros: sAMOLED display and battery are this phones' biggest usp. Display is awesome. Battery back up combined with fast charging is deadly combo. Good camera for the price range, fiddled with pro settings to get some good pics. Not a gamer, hence not able to comment on memory intensive performances. Overall a pleasure to use and watch content. Cons: yet to figure out how to tackle the auto conversion of long SMS into MMS issue in native messenger app.learned it is common in some Samsung phone series. It's annoying at present. Glass is not gorilla. (Not a mention of the type used, anywhere) so have to go for a tempered glass additionally. Speakers are a tad low on volume and fidelity."

133296,mobile,"Hi. I have purchased the product in the month of May 2019. The product used to work very well but all of a sudden one side of the earphone stopped working. Still there is a warranty period for this product. As the product is under warranty i requested for warranty claim on this. But without any reason they have rejected my claim. It is really an unexpected thing from JBL. Being a huge company they should first care for their customers and should try to find what is problem in their product, instead they are rejecting. Such a worst service. Previously I used boAT. The service they have provided during Warranty period is really appreciable. I will never go with JBL again. The worst service provider."
111059,mobile,Absolute battery beast of a phone. 2 days of regular use is easily possible with mobile data or wifi turned on throughout. The display is very nice too. I was worried about the plastic back but the build quality feels quite nice and its survived a few drops from pocket height without any damage despite not having a case or screen protector. The fingerprint reader could be a bit faster but it reads reliably and consistently irrespective of angle or direction. The camera quality was a little disappointing. Performance is great in some conditions and average in most despite the triple shooter. I was hoping it would grow on me but the width of the camera panel on the back is still a bit of an eyesore. Otherwise the aesthetics are quite nice and the opal black variant's gradient feels unique and eye catching. I recommend a clear case or cover to show it off. Overall a solid phone at this price range that I strongly recommend. The battery life is absolutely unbeatable and everything else is generally up to the mark even if it isn't too flashy.
119211,mobile accessories,"Camera ok, battery life satisfy, not for gaming, fingerprint reader not good"

110050,books,"Think And Grow Rich' is one of the Best Books I have read ever on Self Help. The title is a misnormer. It doesnot only teach 'How to make Money', but infact 'anything we desire'. It Starts with simple things; ""Thoughts are things, and powerful things at that when it has definiteness of purpose, ......it goeson..."" I have not read any book worth a million Dollars other than this classic Masterpiece treatise. Napolean Hill is at his best after his celebrated "" The Law of Success"". A must read by all who want to acquire practically anything. There is a secret in this book. Try to find out what that secret of success is all about! I recommend this Self Help Non-Fiction Book very strongly. Nilesh CHOGLE(Author-Together With You Forever)"

142442,mobile accessories,"M20 is a great offering by Samsung and looks like Samsung has a give a lot of thought and time in making the phone.

The battery takes forever to charge and the quick charger is not a quick charger 3. The batter does not last long and even the minimal functioning of the phone needs a lot of power 4. The phone is very heavy and does not fit into your pocket unless you are a giant 5. Here is the fun part .. the screen is totally unprotected and will break even if you drop it casually. yes, mine broke."

I am not much of a gaming person or high end app user, and haven't faced any major issues as yet. The fingerprint reader is good. The camera quality is good but doesn't provide the expected image quality especially during low light. The Battery life is the best part. Comes in with heavy duty battery and I happened to use it for more than 30 hours after watching couple of streaming movies, regular WhatsApp usage, calls and app usages. Overall at the range this is an excellent piece. Worth a buy."

111393,mobile accessories,"After searching for an entire eternity, found this phone - Samsung Galaxy M30 and I couldn't believe the price! Thanks Samsung for looking out for fellows like me! Can you believe that you're getting 3X features phone under 18K?? The marvellous display caught my attention like no otherphone the Super AMOLED FHD+ Infinity U Display of this phone with a screen size of 16.21cm (6.4"") gives you the best visuals ever, with vibrant colours and sharp contrast! And you can view all the content in HD as this phone is enabled with the widevine L1 feature. The juiced-up battery and fast charging features are like every tech lover's dream! Guys, let's face it - low battery is the most heart-breaking thing to see when you are out, This new phone is equipped with a 3X fast charging feature and it comes with a 15W charger., this phone runs on a 5000 mAh battery, so, binge-watch shows or play games on the go without worrying about your phone's battery getting exhausted. This smartphone is equipped with a 13MP + 5MP + 5MP Ultra Wide Triple Rear camera for a good angle of view. just needed a camera like this to capture every moment of my life."
132084,mobile accessories,Great phone at a very nominal price. Happy to have bought it. Infact I bought the M30 too.
133222,mobile,"Hi Team, Have heard a lot about this phone. And i bought but i really disappointed with features of this phone. There is no option for radio, gallery, themes, 3 fingers scrolle down for screen shot, no any additional features like compass, Microsoft office and pattern who will arrange the app in a right manner it looks like to massy. Also whenever i updated system updates first time it always shows that can't be updated while phone is in use while the phone is putting aside. I have one more Mi phone which is note 5 pro and when i compare A2 and 5 pro I would give zero rating to A2. Really pathetic phone waste of money i really don't like any more. And will never suggest anyone to buy this non featured phone. Its looks like i am just using only a colored multimedia phone who has nothing in terms of features. I work in a callcenter where I have to make 150 calls a day, and my phone always has to keep me connected with the charge and headphones. When I bought this phone, it was not written anywhere in the review of this phone nor did it show anywhere in the photo that this phone does not have a separate slot for headphone, you have only charging slot to use the headphone. Now this phone is not in my use. Therefore, I am willing to replace this phone with another phone and will pay the extra money. Or the money of this phone should be returned to me. It is the lack of company due to which the customer is facing trouble. So please change it or arrange the refund back, otherwise I will be forced to go to the consumer court."
127578,smartTv,Good TV with this price but there are some bugs with MI. You cannot transfer files (apk. not in play store). The worst part is installation of this TV. One of the worst services by Amazon Home Services. You will die by calling them but you would not get any satisfactory response from them and finally you have to install it by calling local technician.

Sometimes we have to try connecting for 5-10 times to connect with your mobile. It's little frustrating but apart from that pictures are great. No worries till now. Will update of any in a few days of my usage.Dont look back it a semi mid range DSLR. Better than any entry level camera out there. You won't regret this one. don't waste money on a costly body. Spend that money on a premium lens. I am even looking forward to buy a 50mm or 35mm lens.

136621,refrigerator,I purchased this product in Nov 2018...hardly 8 months into warranty and the Bezel sensor is not working..when I visited the service centre they highlighted a damage which I dont agree to and have quoted me 8000/ for repairs..Moreover Samsung Service centre executives dont talk properly..They are not helpful at all..Have to fight it out with their Service supervisor to get it done free as this is under warranty...They claim due to liquid damage the bezel sensor is not working..this is absolutely nonsense..they wont listen to me and have forcibly registered a damage.. Even otherswise I find this product not accurate when it comes to measuring Hearbeats...Also battery will not even last a full marathon if the bluetooth and GPS is on... Samsung claims this product is water resistent but mere few drops of rain and maybe sweat could have seeped into the product and damaged the Bezel sensor..Does this mean I should properly tape the watch when I wear it for any activity..How sensitive..not at all rugged..I guess good to keep it inside a show case. How reasonable is making one pay 8000/ within 8 months of purchase which they claim as damage...moreoever my watch is at the service centre and no one has the courtesy to call me and update.. Hopeless product absolutely frustrating service..
165242,mobile,"Well, One of the best decision to invest money in electronics. This phone is really a masterpiece. What a build quality, what a camera, what a surround sound, what an amoled screen, what a great software optimization of Android. It is impossible to find a phone with this level of performance in this price bracket. I ordered it the moment it launched and never felt it was a wrong decision. 400000, 256 GB. What else you want. Now my phone has double the Ram my laptop has. Do you belive that? The 90 hz display is awesome..Great job oneplus as always. Keep it up. Just onething you should change. This phone is not a mid range phone. So, please make sure to put a headset inside it. That will be a bang for the buck."

149936,mobile,"PROS:- 1) Good display 2) Best Battery life and back up (if used only when essential it gives upto 3 days on a single charge) 3) Face recognition is good 4) Video Wallpapers and themes are good which makes other people around you to wonder what kind a phone is it 5) Best for normal usage only. CONS:- 1) Camera though 48 Megapixel, quality is like mere 8 Megapixel phone. 2) Finger Print sensor is slow, does not recognize instantly and takes a 2 seconds to unlock. 3) RAM althogh 4GB, free space is almost 1.5GB, I don't even have games on it, still it occupies most of the space. 4) Not for Heavy Gamers, it is for normal use. 5) Less options in camera settings. These were just some pros and cons after a week use. The phone is not for gamers and not a camera phone. Although not extensively, i have tested other phones in this price range and almost all phones come with 48MP camera (cheap quality). Use it as your daily work phone, listen to music, surf the web, watch movies on it or only when essential, the phone will keep you happy. Regards."

135145,mobile accessories,"I have been using it for past few days, sound quality and call quality is good. Sound is highly emphasized on base, so base lovers will love it. The only problem I give 3 stars is that there is a connectivity issue. When we play some videos or music the audio comes out from the speaker even though the earphones are connected to it. That's the biggest flaw. Otherwise it's a great product at this price point."

135188,mobile accessories,"I have been using this phone for a year now, and I am quite satisfied. Now I am not a person who buys a phone for the camera , so if you are looking feedback on camera, I am not the best person. Having said that, I have taken a few selfies and a decent number of photos and no one complained üòä . Now I did play games like pubg and mortal kombat and they work very well. Watched a lot of movies and listened to good number of songs. So the screen quality and the audio is good. Battery life, with whole day browsing and few calls, it lasts for 2 days. If you play games you need to charge it daily. This is the 2nd Samsung phone. The previous one is a Note 3 neo, which still works and is 6 years old. Just changed it since it was Android 4.4 and 3gb ram , so the games were a bit slow. The one down side of the phone is the glass like finish which makes it bit difficult to grip, so a cover is definitely recommended . The finger print unlock is good, but you may not like the face recognition, I for sure did not. So to summarize, if you are looking for a good phone which is a all rounder and also expect a good life, I would recommend this phone."

Camera best in day light than non other brand,I haven't yet made a picture in night light. You can note the colour crispness seen as in original. Depth of the camera is simply awesome you can see it of that flower pic. Battery life full 2 days backup even when data is on. Finger print and face recognition is at the best response. Sounds are clear even at crowded places. It takes 2.30min for a full charge from 0 to 100. The notch which is present is so beautiful when the notification lights glow. The screen saver pictures are awesome which are upto date and gives the current news in a flash on the display. Over all a good phone at this price range."

Battery though is of 6000Mah, It lasts only for a day on moderate use. The Battery performance can definitely be improved. Plastic back is a little issue, but itne paise me itnaich milega.. Camera is awesome, it got all modes except Macro ;-) If we get this somehow.. It will be amazing. One last, the size of charger cable is not upto the mark.

Might need to get it checked from warranty claim. :( END EDIT. Nice phone. I wish the fingerprint sensor was a more leveled because it is difficult to detect it properly on first try. But it is very worth it at the net price of 11,600."

Pairs with the phone instantly except for the first time till it registers."

169590,smartTv,perfect
120009,mobile,Cons: 1) Charging point is totally different than usual Charging points of Samsung hence one need to keep carrying charger along with him or purchase 2 to 3 chargers. 2) Camera quality is very poor. It's like normal phone Camera. 3) unable to connect to USB by OTG due to different shape of Charging port. 4) Battery life is not good. It's as if of normal phone. 5) Samsung should not fool the ppl. They should not try to bring down their brand image by such claims without onground features.

118008,mobile,Best!! Smartphone in this prize range . It was my first realme product and the experience was unbelievable. It definitely gives you the premium experience when you hold the headset . The camera is awesome. Usually I like snapdragon processor but when start using this device which mediatek helio P70 I must say that snapdragon have to do more better because it definitely beats snapdragon 660 . Firstly before buying this device I watched few reviews on youtube which we all generally do but some the reviews made afraid for buying this device but I all want to say that the user can only give you the correct review because you all can see every you tube channels have different reviews and this make people confuse about that product . So always see review of user before buying the product and this had definetly did a great job and must say that now people will move to real me from mi or many other companies . Great job realme best of luck for future device and looking forward for next smartphone .üëçüèª

151062,mobile,Picture quality is good with good battery life however the sound is low as compared to Mi Note 5 Pro. Having said that the speakers r good enough and is not an issue. Delivery by Amazon Prime guy was pathetic. Had to follow up multiple times and requests to have it delivered. Very very pathetic experience for a prime subscriber.
154637,smartTv,"So the problem is basically with it's GPU unit. It turns off automatically somehow I am still trying to figure out what is wrong and there is nothing wrong actually it is commanded by ASUS, to save battery life and you have to restart the laptop to turn on the GPU agan, that is so very annoying and you can't do anything about this problem. But the thing is sometimes GPU shuts down in 5 minutes of restart. very disapointed with this purchase, it only gives me 30fps and GPU shuts down in between games and you have to again restart the laptop and GPU again will somehow shut down after no significant period of time. Poor product from ASUS. I am so mad puchasing this product. Don't ever go for it! Take my words for it. Thank you ASUS. P.S. - Nothing is wrong with Amazoon here, their delivery, product handling was great, it was two-day-delivery and product is genune, so hats off to amazon for taking good care of products and I hope this review gets some attention from Amazon customer service team as well."

115815,refrigerator,Battery life is excellent and the body and band size is little small as per the other bands which was quite upset.
158914,books,"The way the author has gone about explaining two different personalities both earning money but different ways is a reality bite, which a normal person fails to realise if he is a employee. It‚Äôs true that middle class and poor people despise rich and affluent but again as it is showed in this book despising them fails us to think how rich think, bcuz we already hate that rich people so much why would we want to be like them. I think there lies the basic flaw why all cudnt be financially free. The author has explained the principles rightly but reaching the financial freedom as the author has explained with the real estate seems bit superficial. Yes the author has achieved it, but he doesn‚Äôt explain the complete story. In reality , life punishes you for being free spirited and doing as we wish then rewards you."

I couldnt agree to this option that the magnified effect makes picture more wider but more blured i coulndt get a proper picture of anything using that mode.the only feature i could agree is that the battery life is more when compared to any others .its amazing ,i got to use the phone 5-6 hours constant using internet,but there is no sign of heating and less amount of battery drained . Without using internet i can use the phone upto 15 hours"

133624,mobile,"I am an iphone user since 2012, bought one plus 7t for my wife. She is avid android user and her 3t‚Äôs screen fell apart. So i bought ltest flagship for her. I dont care for refresh rate, huge screens specifications etc and my review is simply based on usability of phone. I use it for a whilw, make calls, check calender, watch netflix, use keyboard and judge it. if it doesnt hang its good to go. As simple as that. Pro‚Äôs- one plus has introduced gestures in place of generic 3 android buttons, gestures are just like iphone, swipe from bottom to close app, slide hold for multi tasker, slide left to right to go back and so on. Gestures were accurate. So kinda felt like using iphone. One plus has introduced cool animated wallpapers. They are really appealing. Back of phone is slight matte. Looks better than glossy back although a fingerprint magnet. Screen is good, a resolution of 1080p Speakers are loud. Fluid and smooth. Good night mode and camera lightens selfies. Fast charging. Cons- Camera is ‚Äòokayish‚Äô. Cant compare it with iphones camera at all. Although skin was lightened and night mode was good. (Compared to two years old iphone x) Gets slightly heat up during app updation. Size is really huge. Cant use it in single hand at all. Heavy. No headphone in the box. An android. So, if you are an android user, you should go for it. Good for next 3 years. Not much different from previously launched one plus phones."

134251,smartTv,"I bought this Phone last year December, few days back I faced some issue like some noise when i click home button and also some feature issue, as phone was in warranty so I visited B2X (Authorised Apple Support center). 1. For the hardware issue they opened my Iphone7 , and he told me it is not genuine product OR i have opened my mobile outside authorised center. I was sure it is the first time that phone is open. He told me there should be one seal in Iphone products which is not there also display was having some red sticker on it [which is not present in genuine or Apple store] so he told me if I send this phone to Apple store they will not reclaim as they don't support 3rd party products. 2. Regarding software issue --> he suggested to update IoS to 12.0.1 i told him you do it via cable so that I will not miss any package over wifi. Then he told if I update from my side there is chances that Iphone will not bootup as it is not genuine (told in point 1) Now my suggestion please buy expensive phones from Authorised stores only you will get here some discount but may be you have to pay big amount later. Note --> All conversation is same which B2X told me, they can also be fake... but it was big shock for me that it is not genuine."

157439,mobile,The cellphone is a significant upgrade to M30 the USP of the phone is 6000 MaH battery which lasts longer than 26 hrs. 4gb 64gb variant is more than enough for users with basic gaming and cell phone needs. M30s triple camera is a powerful one equipped with AR Emoji feature which is a good one to have fun with. Several features like super slo mo and super steady makes this cell phone stand out from the others. Would recommend everyone to go for this if you want to buy a excellent cell phone with all the new features introduced in 2019.

110618,mobile,"A good buy, its easy to install & operate. Durable & didn't give in to virus attacks like the Samsung SD card thankfully. Wish it was tad easier on the pocket though."
155851,mobile,Super product. Exactly as was expected from Samsung. Specs are really good though yet to try out the camera especially at night. Will update subsequently on that. However bloatware is an issue which Samsung needs to look into. Otherwise the android experience is very good so far.
158453,smartTv,"The product is good creation. The remote does not respond immediately many times. We have to press the buttons 3 - 4 times to execute the command. The Volume does not work on voice recognition. Also, most content, the volume of TV has to be around 90 plus for clear voice. Else the product is really good."
120741,mobile,"Display quality is not as per standered as apple , when i use this fone , i could have feel stress in my eyes ."
124438,smartTv,"For this price range, product is just off the charts. I would recommend it to anybody. Decent looking, thin, weightless. Played videos up to 4k, plays it smooth. Couldn't be happier. Thanks to MI for a great product and on time techie for visiting n installing and thanks to Amazon for the quick and safe delivery."

169612,mobile accessories,phone Quality is very good and camera is good but bettry is just going to use 1 day only that is problem
113229,mobile accessories,"At First I was in doubt, whether should I go for this Online purchase or not. But the purchase was good for me at 35,999/-. Received New Product and got registered at Apple site and received 1 year warranty. I am fan of Apple products always. As my last phone iPhone 4 bought at 42,000/- and lasted for 5 years. Then I used Android and I was pissed up with usage and again planned get back to iPhone. iPhone 6s is best in all aspects size wise handy, screen size 4.7 is sufficient enough for me (I never used phone for watching movies, sometimes I go for small YouTube videos), No complain on speed at all as iPhone is always best in speed. Photo picture quality is awesome. If you want to go for this, do not give second thought."

124885,mobile,"Giving this review after 2 months of usage.. completes all my charging needs, slim body made of aluminium, supports fast charging n takes only about 6 hours to get fully charged.. üòé"
159234,smartTv,This TV is better than any TV in this price range. Use a Android TV box or Fire stick to enjoy 4K content. Pros: Good quality Picture Good quality Sound Budget friendly TV 4K Support Cons: - No picture setting option for internal apps but HDMI/TV. - No sound in Amazon Prime Videos if casting through Google's cromecast. Anyway this is not that important for all. - Need to manually set the WIFI connection if internet gets disconnected. - Playing 4K from internal YouTube will hang/freeze the TV. External 4K streaming device is the only solution. - Low RAM management Overall 4 star for quality and performance but can be given 5 star due to the attractive price and also the drawbacks can be ignored at this price segment.
135256,mobile,I have changed my phone from an APPLE IPHONE 7 to this phone. One of the main reasons was the MONSTER Battery this was providing. Very happy with the purchase. The battery last almost 1.5 days with heavy usage. Camera could have been of a better quality though its decent. Phone is lightweight and build is good too. Value for money purchase this phone is Would rate 4.5/5
114507,smartTv,Awesome product
133468,smartTv,How to utilise all features were not explained during installation and demo. So most of the inbuilt features could not be utilitized forever by user due to no knowledge to use it.
134306,smartTv,"I bought this machine for resource intensive computing purpose and not gaming exactly. My immediate review of the product is as follows. Pros 1. Looks not very gamerish. Even though it bears a full plastic body, but it still has a good feel to it. 2. You get the Intel 9560 wifi which is amazing. 3. The viewing angles are fabulous. 4. The speakers are also great. 5. The 8300H processor performs great. Cons 1. Installing Linux is a pain due to the driver installation. The most compatible distro is Ubuntu 18.10. 2. Heavy. At 2.7Kgs, it's a very heavy machine. 3. Battery life. The battery life could've been better. I'm getting 4 hours on normal usage and 1.2 hours on resource intensive usage. All in all, if you're a student with a budget, go for it."

Flawless performance. Fantastic Camera. Incredible UI. Good battery backup. Likeable Earpods. NOTE: SIM slot opener is not included in the box. Use Move to iOS Android app for transferring the contents from your Android device to iPhone."
135625,smartTv,"I know the product is good, but it is not compatiable with my laptop bluetooth, therse is no problem in my laptop bluetooth, dont know why it is not connected to my laptop"
148727,smartTv,"One of the best Apple products I have used so far. It's lightning fast with the 2GB RAM and the Taptic feedback on the Home button also feels good. However, the most alluring aspect of the device is its impeccable camera - from OIS technology to the aperture, everything combines to produce amazing images. Though the battery capacity could have been a little more, it surely makes up for that with its fast charging prowess. I recommend this phone to all who want to get a compact phone with a horde of features and beastly power."

The appearance may look good. But due to technical faults I would like to rate it 4/10."

Iphone has 3d touch,brand value,ios,beautiful camera, headphones(music) is best in the phone,design,light weight wowww many more. I can say 1+5 dominant iphone by their battery life but many of them dono the reality, 1+5 device support dash charge only with one plus charger and if ue charge your iPhone with original charge it will charge quick.

However the colours look great on the glass back. Oxygen OS software is buttery smooth as well. Battery life is great on standby, however as you begin using it, the drain is slightly more than expected. Nevertheless it charges up fast. Fingerprint scanner is blazing fast. Display is vibrant and the brightness levels are great as well. Overall a great buy for the price."

110595,mobile,A good Mobile ... Working well. But Mi mobile are always of more ads. So occupies many space that's the big problem other than that it's working fine
158133,mobile,The phone is quite slim and smooth and gives a nice feel to the hands. The rear camera requires a little more of work but still gets the picture clicked in a decent way. The only thing this phone lacks is the absence of a 32MP front camera which would have just made the whole experience great. Battery backup is really a monster and has no comparison in its cost segment. Samsung had developed an amloed display so they give the best in class display experience. Overall the phone is packed with features and is more than what anyone can bargain in the cost.
141681,smartTv,Like
124729,mobile accessories,"Galaxy M20 is overall good deal to buy, fingers scanner work quickly. Camera performance is not as my expectations it's not capture the natural colours, wide angle camera performance is same as normal one, live focus is doing great job focus is not loose while making a video. I'm totally impressed with the battery life and M20 support of fast changing and you can save your battery life by using night mode and power mode. The one thing which give it bad impression is gaming, if you're a heavy gamer you'll disappointed with the performance, when I play Asphalt 9 mobile start overheating and the application crash itself, it's really a big issue for any mobile gaming lover. I'll give it 3.5 stars for the overall usability."

Not much apps.. Suggest to use andriod box for better android experience. SD channels are fair quality view use with setting upscale to HD quality.. But compared to HD channels it is inferior. Screen is super bright and i am using with 50% less brightness for better view. The company app is not able to register the product...don't know why but will keep trying.

137757,smartTv,Improve colour combinations to soft colours in OS and pixel density..
157522,smartTv,The device switched on and off on its own for the first month.. especially while getting connected to WiFi.. also.. cannot cast Netflix despite built in cast feature (which frankly needs a disclaimer).. the only app that works fine in India is hotstar.. very disappointing..

154502,smartTv,"So I was following this model for a while and did not really find much on this TV online other than a few comparative videos generally comparing LG models. I have absolutely no idea why the 6360 outsells this model when there is such a huge difference in picture quality between the 6360 and this one - 6780. I must clarify that I did not purchase it on Amazon as when I did decide to buy it, it got sold out for a few days. So I purchased it for Rs. 42k from a local dealer. After seeing as much as I could online on this TV - which is very limited as this appears to be an India specific model - I could not see a demo in the shop as it was only a packed piece. I was thoroughly confused between this one, the LG 6360, the Samsung NU7470, some Sony models, VU and TCL. I was sure I wanted a 4k panel. To be honest, Sony still has one of the best panels in the market in general, but they really need to get their act together as far as pricing and smart features are concerned. As far as the Samsung NU 7470 is concerned, it is a great TV, but has a VA panel as opposed to an IPS that the LG 6780 has (read up on this - deep blacks in VA as opposed to better viewing angles in IPS - a trade off - I personally prefer IPS panels). Plus the NU7470 was around 5k-6k more expensive than the LG 6780. But I did see the 7470 in the shop and PQ was amazing. However, I finally settled for 6780 as for INR 42k, this has a panel, IMHO has a far better than the NU7470. Plus it has a 35w sound output with a built-in sub-woofer, brilliant connectivity features. Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hotstar, Alt Balaji, Zee, work like a breeze on this model, and last but not the least - the super amazing Magic Remote with a pointable mouse and click-wheel - and voice control!! I must warn that when you do go for an extended warranty, please take the original LG extended warranty (costs around 8.5k for 3 years - so total 4 years) as opposed to a authorised reseller warranty (which may be cheaper - but involve a bit of a process to claim it as the reseller has to coordinate warranty repairs after the first year for you). I got the reseller warranty but have put in a request to change it to the original LG warranty. Once the TV got home, the LG technician came within 30 mins and he was super happy that I had purchased this model. Apparently this is their best model now in the 43"" segment and most people overlook this model. He said that only the ones who do their homework end up buying this model as they know that this is the best bang for the buck. When the TV was turned on, I was quite blown away. The PQ was probably the best that I had seen in mid-range 43"" 4k TVs. I was very kicked. There was no comparison between the LG 6780 and all of the other brands and models I had seen. The intent of writing this slightly detailed review is to put more material on this TV out there as there isn't much on this online. So if you're out there looking for this model and are confused, just go for this blindly! The main difference between this one and the 6360 is the difference in sound - 20W vs 35W and the 6360 has an ""IPS 4K Panel"" whereas this model - the 6780 - has an ""Ultrabright IPS 4k Panel"". I kid you not, the Ultrabright makes all the difference in the viewing experience. Even some of the resellers do not really know the technical difference between the two models and usually push the 6360 model. Hope someone find this review helpful. PROS: 1. ""Ultra-bright"" IPS 4K Panel with fantastic viewing angles 2. 35W sound output with sub-woofer. No need for a soundbar. 3. Magic Remote with click wheel 4. WEB OS is quite intuitive and friendly - with an excellent browser 5. Voice commands 6. 3 HDMI and 2 USBs + Optical Sound Output + The other usual outputs 7. Fantastic after sales support with on site support - this is a huge plus CONS: 1. Build quality could have been a tad better - Don't mistake me, it is well built for a sub-woofer inside. 2. Stands could be a little more sturdy - perhaps metal instead of plastic? 3. Magic remote costs 7-8k if it gets busted - so use carefully without dropping. Probably should get a cover for it on Amazon which costs around INR 800."

The phone has definite positives: Excellent screen display, very fast action due to 6 GB RAM. Storage is more than enough even if you are taking photos every minute. Good interface, Android One is too good. Battery life is really good, more than 24 hours in spite of Mobile data on. As such I do not want to pin point any negatives for this phone. REAL VALUE FOR MONEY"

146962,smartTv,"No problems with display quality. The sound is loud, but there is a problem with sound when viewing DTH channels. The dialogue is muffled a little bit. No changes to the equaliser could give me satisfactory results. Also the TV is THICK, my 9 year old TV was way slimmer, also the wall mount provided is not slim, so there is a lot of gap between TV and the wall(very disappointed with this one). Also note the fact that the TV has a plasticky cheap feel to it. Despite all these flaws, i dont regret my decision. Edit: The apps on TV are quite good, most major apps are covered. I had to buy a sound bar to address the muffled dialogue problem."

They claim it is water resistant and 'NOT' necessarily water proof. 2. Step counter gets activated even while travelling in vehicles while you are actually seated and stationary. Same with Floor targets. Travelling over flyovers adds to the floor counter. 3. No Samsung Pay in India models."

Tomorrow Vcare person is expected to visit and take a look at the TV. Will update or cancel my order based on his evaluation. Update 6th Nov 10 Nobody from Vcare or Metz showed up yet. Pathetice people, cancelled my order. One big advise, dont ever exchage your items for new products on Amazon. Sell them seperately on OLX etc. In carrent case I lost my old 50 inch TV and had to return new Metz 50 inch TV as all their models are defective."

156878,mobile accessories,"The M30 has a class-leading screen, which comes with the added benefit of further improved battery life - again to levels no competitor can match. The Galaxy M30 is great all-rounder and makes a very compelling case for someone who doesn't find 3D gaming or camera performance particularly important. You still get to enjoy a very nice display and the outstanding battery life. Pros Exceptional battery life, okay charging speed. One of the best displays you can have in the segment. An ultra wide camera is hard to find in this class. Good portraits, really nice selfies. Dedicated microSD slot. Cons Plasticky build. Unexciting image quality from the rear cameras. No 4K recording even though the chipset supports it; no stabilization in 1080p either. You can get a more powerful chipset at this price point."

You can barely manage to pull out 1 day if using your phone heavily throughout the day UI is just awesome Such a smooth touch feedback Overall a good deal My suggestion - although black one looks classic but it just looks like any other phone. So i would suggest to go with other color choices that make your phone look different from others

158983,mobile accessories,There is a lot of heating issue like 40 degree on video calling through any app or charging with powerbank in just 10 to 15 minutes. Network strength capacity is also weak. I wanted to return this but Amazon condition through bolancco app I couldn't replace this. This app shows everything ok in 40 degree. How can u do this? In this temperature it's a heaterüò°. It is not suitable for Samsung brand. If u leave the Samsung brand then other handset is better in this range. Front camera is also not good.
165164,mobile,"Well all in all good product but one thing that would hurt u is battery it has 3000 mah battery which is preety less for 6 gb ram. When you love to play games like PUBG, but still its ok. Go for it guys"
119690,mobile,Censor is not working when made a call. Screen off when kept the mobile beside ear after dilailling a call but screen is not on after or middle of the call when kept away from the ear. Camera quality is not up to the expectation to that of 48 MP. Totally 2.5 out of 5 rating is giving to this mobile. Very disappointing one from Amazon.
121874,smartTv,Everything things good... Good camera... High storage... Body light weight... Mobile plastic good hard quality... Good size nice to use... But battery backup is low... Charger is not good... It's 5volt you should buy 6volt battery... Because in 5volt and mobile function compression... Charger mobile become heat after 1hour when you charging... I suggest you... When you buy mobile... If Function have some little compression price.. You should 1st see battery and charger volt... If you like High function quality mobile then go..good battery 3000mag above or 4000mah and charger capacity to charge 6volt...

112147,smartTv,Amazing Tv. Good product by Panasonic in this range. A tough competition for Sony. Nice Sound and picture quality by Panasonic.
136627,smartTv,I purchased this product on 18 Oct within a month I started having lot of tech problems. The operating system keeps crashing. In the middle of watching something it happened a lot of times now lost count. Have to reset it whenever the OS crashes. After the technician resets the problem reoccurs again. The MI service has just informed me that replacement is not available after first 10 days. Which is not a good thing. The problem here is a technical issue of system crash but still they dont have a replacement of TV. It's waste if the system crashes you cannot use it for any purpose. Also had a trouble with the remote which runs on Bluetooth pairing which dysfunctioned too soon within six months of purchase. Also there is no Amazon prime or Netflix support cannot download from the play store as well. I watch only hotstar and YouTube on TV The Netflix cannot be directed casted from the app on this TV also. You can only chrome cast I.e Tab cast but the picture quality is horrible and black looks purple on TV after casting. If the OS crashes this TV cannot be used for anything and is a total waste of money and time. DONT BY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS THERE IS A GOOD GUARANTEE OR WARRANTY OPTION FOR REPLACEMENT OF FAULTY PRODUCT LIKE I GOT
160444,mobile,"This phone was released almost 1.5 years and still have it's own charm.We were to buy a secondary phone below 12 K and tried to shortlist few of them but however you sort it based on different priorities , the note 5 pro pops out as no.1. As usual I am impressed with Portrait camera , built in IR remote helps for DTH :)(one cool feature), Slim screen with super speed UI ( Faster than my 50k S8+)... The charging is not fast charging but few reviews suggest that certain fast chargers are compatible to feed it with fast charging.. Only con is it does not come with a headset.. Rest is super cool and it is "" Still an amazing phone"""

122229,mobile,Excellent For this price segment this phone is a killer . For a normal usage we get a battery for atleast 3 days For heavy usage 1.5 days Pros : Camera quality 6000 mah battery Finger print and face unlock No lag Cons: Due to 6000 mah battery atleast they should have went for 25 W fast charger rather than 15 W which is taking much time to charge.. But still considering the price segment this phone deserves more than 5 stars .... Best phone from Samsung to make MI oppo vivo all this China made brand quite..

123088,refrigerator,Excellent watch with amazing look. Pros- Super AMOLED display Gorilla glass Tizen os- very fast and smooth operation Rotating Bazel- Exclusive feature Accurate fitness tracking Speaker and mic very clear sound Inbuilt GPS WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity Gear browser - very good ..you can almost open anything Watch faces- always on feature is awesome Here are few important tips for WiFi connectivity and Spotify as I had to spend a lot of time to figure it out... WiFi connectivity- v good...you need to disable auto sync WiFi from phone wear app to seamlessly connect to your watch otherwise it will ask you enter WiFi password everytime you switch from Bluetooth to WiFi network. Cons- Charging- wireless charging but you have to try 3-4 times to fit properly Battery- 2 days with heavy use ..could have been better but I would not complain.you can extend it with battery saver function Watch faces- though you will get lots of free wathfaces but for some good ones you need to pay --For Spotify stand-alone mode you need to get premium subscription..remote function allows you to play it on phone only not on your watch..in premium version you can stream music on your watch without connecting to phone ...you just need a WiFi connection. Map- need a better app for GPS map and navigation Overall- Excellent watch with premium build quality. Very prompt and good delivery by seller Appario If you want a stylish smart watch with all the features just go for this...
140145,mobile accessories,It's very bad
133383,mobile accessories,Honestly saying this is the best phone under 15k. I have purchased 2 phones blue nd black both are working perfectly fine. It does not come with fast charging still it does not take too long to charge and the best part is selfie and battery backup is superb... Go for it without any secound thought. I find black colour more classy than blue as have both of them.

A good phone to go for, if you‚Äôre looking at under 20k category."

I've been using it for the past 3 months almost, and its exceeded all expectations I've had by far. Stunning picture quality, crisp and great (loud) sound, supports all formats (and I've played 10 bit 4k videoes by the dozens), and an all-rounder SMART TV that can compete with the best out there!

118356,mobile accessories,"Bought it about a week ago, everything seems to be working fine as of now. Technical specification can be read in the product description and believe me product stands up to its reputation. Siri seems wacky at times as I have to use the activation command before it gets it, not sure if its a issue with my voice or setting or the receiver, would monitor it for some time. I am not a heavy user of the phone, though there's no unreasonable heating issue. Battery seems to be performing decently. All in all, there is a feel good factor as of now. Would continue to monitor the performance and would post a comprehensive review later. Thanks !!"

140492,mobile,"Its been 4 days now that I've been using this phone and it's a battery beast!! Battery life has been incredible on this device. It gave me a whopping 2 days of usage with moderate to heavy usage on a single charge. The display is spectacular. No issues in sunlight, no struggles in the night time, it is smooth to eyes even in complete dark. The processor is also a beast I am a heavy user and use 5-6 apps at once and it manages to keep it all in memory with no struggles whatsoever. Cameras are also superb. Love the ultra wide cam. Front camera is good enough for instant social media uploads. If you are looking for a smartphone under 15k, forget oppo, vivo and redmi, this is it!"
158351,refrigerator,"The product and delivery, both are awesome"
142694,mobile accessories,"Merits:- 1. Been using it for last 5 month. The earphone's sound and the bass is mindblowing. 2. Once if u fix the earphone into the ear you can't hear anything from outside even without playing songs. 3. About the charging, they have mentioned 6hrs standby but it will be upto 7 to 9 hrs also if you are using it continually. 4. Sweat proof is also awesome, Very flexible, weightless. Demerit:- 1. Ear buds are not perfectly fit but u can enjoy enjoy the music."

137911,mobile accessories,In this price range sound quality is very good and base also I am writing this review ofter using it for two months
159170,mobile accessories,"Things which i want to tell everyone seriously- 1 It has no comparison with Sd660 but according to #AntutuScore comparison and as per my regular use it is matchable with Sd660 no doubt. 2 Battery will be only 33% consumed after 2hr of pubg playback with HD settings, it proves that it is beast in battery. 3 4k playback directly from youtube through chrome browser i will find best result without lag.. make sure ur internet speed must be high. 4 The best is SAmoled panel by samsung. All side viewing angles are best and contrast is awsome. 5 Screen to body ratio is not only acceptable whereas its perfect because u can enjoy any video and your daily apps with better screen size and space. 6 Dolby atmos gives u customization and total surround sound experience in ur regular headphones as well but if u have supported one then u cn get best sound experience. 7 widevine L1 certification gives u full Hd 1080p in prime video as well as netflix content access and seriously i am watching alot of series on netflix now a days in my galaxy m30 and its crystal clear with best contrast and colour quality. 8 The more u talk so u have camera because main sensor of 13 mp is perfect and can give u best shots in daylight as well as night shots with flash and 5 for depth sensing is in live focus gives u perfect edge detection. 5 mp wide angle has some lack of details but its acceptable in day condition and seriously it has acceptable camera and front camera has best in class because 16 mp in other brands will not provide u samsung like quality but its awsome and face unlock is very responsive even in dark place it works 200%. 8 finally its look and build quality is great because it has polycarbonate so its great and deservable because it feels like premium glass as all edges are round so u can use #Kapaver case cost of Rs. 599 on amazon because i m using this its very strong. 9. Exynos 7904 14nm technology will not disappoints u because its samsung's new mid range gen processor and it can handles every heavy thing in ur mobile and i am using this as my daily driver without a single lagg. So ultimately u can buy this but switch for 6gb/128gb variant for future concern and in Rs17990 it has no match.. Do not go for negative reviews because everyone has something to say when any big brand launches things in their price brackets. So choose with ur wise and experience the thing acc to heart."
158881,mobile,"The unit which i received made me to rethink about my purchase and Oneplus quality. Reason are:- - Never in last couple of years have i faced any heating issue with Oneplus 5,6,6t until i purchased 7t - 90hz screen refresh rate really ?? When you pack high end features relatively low priced phone (although with SD 855+) it results in screen flickering, hanging problem, and heating at the back - Despite having same can setup as 7pro ( my best frnd's) , it is quite noticeable that the pics aren't that sharp and detailed once zoomed in and seen later - Quick charge yes but quick draining of battery charge? Not a Oneplus thing despite of 3800 mah battery I wish i could have been able to return phone but Amazon policies suck."
138064,books,Interesting !!
161530,mobile accessories,Using almost 6months premium quality wired earphone
165633,mobile,"Within the price range of ~17,000 for 6GB,128GB model (and ~15000 for 4GB,64GB) this phone is a brilliant option to buy. And the 6000mAh battery, it really monstrous one within this price range. Adding to it is the camera (48Mp + 8Mp(ultrawide)+ 5MP depth sensor) is really an awesome feature of this phone. Although there are some bloatware present in this phone but that's minimal. Being a huge data and battery using consumer myself, this phone is giving some really satisfactory results. Playing PUBG and Shadow Fight 3 at ultra graphics has very minute lags(all thanks to Samsung's new Exynos 9611 SoC) and the phone can easily sustain 1 whole day with continuous heavy usage with it's humongous 6000mAh battery.In addition to that Samsung's features like data saving, night mode, VPN on Samsung MAX, Ultra data saver and even triple slot SIM tray is like garnish on top of a delicious cuisine. And even the back finish is really best in class, personally I like opal black more than the blue counterpart. All in all it's a must buy phone if you're looking for an awesome phone within ~15,000/~20,000 budget."

139951,mobile,It's not up to the mark. Camera quality could have been much better as it comes with 48mp camera setup but it does not reach the same. In the same price range so many options available in the market with superb camera quality and processor as well. But one thing I must appreciate the Samsung for making available this phone in such aggressive price with super amoled display and the delivery in such a quick time is much impressive from Amazon
165473,mobile accessories,"While ordering the phone I thought that it would be good even after viewing some of the negative reviews specially about cameras but the phone disappointed me also in more aspects. First, more than 30% battery drains out within 5 hours without doing any heavy task just upgrading apps and device. Second, processor is not up to mark. I played dancing lines and it suffered while running. Earlier I had redmi note 5 pro which ran the game very smoothly. Third, as in most of the reviews camera quality is not good as specified. It is first time I made a very bad choice. The specifications are only in papers not in real life."

164274,mobile,Very nice product
152403,mobile accessories,"Pros: 1. Looks like premium phone (9/10). 2. Battery life is very good even 3750mah you can get 1 day of heavy usage and 1.5 day for normal usage (8.5/10). 3. SOT is almost 6hrs (7.5/10). 4. Camera is best in this price segment (8/10). 5. Camera in night is ok not that much great (7/10). 6. Heat management is good(gets little bit warm) even if you play heavy games like PUBG and Asphalt9 (8.5/10). 7. loud speaker is adequate, you can receive call but its not very loud (7/10). 8. Screen quality is too good you will experience its full screen view because of its little chin at bottom (9/10). Cons: 1. Build quality is not that much good(6.5/10). 2. Missing IR sensor as in Honor phones. 3. Doesn't provide fast charging because of USB Type-A. 4. It will take 2.15hrs from 0 to 100 (7/10). 5. Notch display will not show any notification icon (6/10). 6. Honor phone are very slow in releasing OS updates (6/10). Overall worth of money in this price segment. I am using 6gb ram, 128gb rom Segment. I feel instead of giving 2MP depth sensor Honor would have provide 5MP then it would have been great."

110917,mobile accessories,A very good phone for the price. Everything about this phone is good in terms of quality and features. There are two cons which I need to mention. One is about a moisture sensor which some time troubles as this phone don't have a wireless charging option and another one is poorly configured proximity sensor which makes the phone to go to hold on between calls.
163673,refrigerator,"Very good smart watch.. superb look.. i'm not a big guy, but still it felt comfortable to wear...

I bought it for Rs14000/- with 6gb&128 GB variant.MRP Rs 16999/- 10% Instant Discount and 1000/- Cash Back from Amazon and free insurance. I have used the handset for 6 Days. I Like everything in this mobile. Camera is excellent. Battery performance is as expected. Touch screen is amazing. HD Display and Dolby Atmos Audio giving the feeling of theater. Rich looks of handset. Overall value for money.
169429,mobile,"not working in 45 days... I Purchased this cable on July 2019, as the product specifications were very good and it looked very rugged too. The cable was very impressive and it worked fine for about 85 days , but after that I found that the cable end connecting towards the phone end become slightly shaky ( from the molded portion connecting the cable )and this has resulted in charging not happening and every time I had to hold this connecting end in a particular position only then it might charge..the moment you leave it won't work..now I can't use this cable. I am not sure if this happened due to wear n tear or if this is the actual life expectancy of this cable and connector. As this cable has a 6 months warranty, I have contacted the OEM and have raised a complaint and awaiting their input. Hope I can get a replacement."

This review contain a comparison between both. Also i share pros & cons. JBL Pros 1. IT HAS MORE BASS AS COMPARES TO CX180 2. VOLUME IS ALSO LOUDER. 3. IT HAS A MIC WHICH IS VERY USEFUL & THIS IS THE MAIN REASON I BUY IT. CONS. 1. IT HAS MORE BASS BUT SOUND IS NOT CLEAR, ON CX180 YOU WILL LISTEN ALL BEATS MUSIC CLEARLY. 2. WIRE BUILD QUALITY IS VERY POOR. MI BASIC WHICH IS APPROX AT RS 350 IS MORE DURABLE THAN THIS. 3. EAR CUSIONS ARE ALSO NOT SOFT, IT HURTS MY EAR AFTER A SHORT USE. 4. AFTER USING THESE FOR APPROX 1 HRS, MY HEAD WAS STARTS TO PAIN. SO FOR RS 700 RANGE SENNHEISER IS PREFECT & BALANCED EARPHONES WITHOUT A MIC."

136533,mobile,I purchased it before 2 days. When I upgrade Security patches it goes in Bootloop mode and nothing is happening. I am not sure if there is bug in security patches why this is being pushed by Mi to update. Awful experience with this handset. I will never suggest to buy.

152978,smartTv,"Really great for its price point (I got it for 58K). Let's dive into the review: Fast 256 GB SSD + 1 TB HDD? Check Ryzen 5 - 3550 H? Check (Yes, single core performance may be less than Intel but it is as good as Intel i5-8300H) [Update 1: According to AMD devs on Twitter, going on to the latest Windows 10 1903 will improve performance significantly to like around 10-15%, I personally haven't done that but will try that soon] 120 Hz Refresh Rate? Check 3 GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050? Check. Battery is at 48 mAH and can stay for around 2 to 3 - 3.5 hours and can even be pushed to 4 hours in Power Saver Mode plus Battery Saver with brightness at 50 %. Normal usage will lead to 2 - 2.5 hours of standby (not bad at all considering the specs). Additional RAM will improve performance (the current is not bad at all just for those who want more. RAM is at 2666 MHz BTW) Most games (I tested NFS 2012, Assassin's Creed: Rogue, MW Series, Black Ops Series, COD: Ghost) run at 60 - 90 fps in medium-high and 70ish on Ultra. [Update 1 : I could easily hit 90+ in the games I tested albeit they don't need as much power as the current gen games. Will update this section as I get newer games.] [Update 2: Played Mirror's Edge: Catalyst on both High & Ultra and on High it ranged from 93 to 107 fps and Ultra is 75-88 ish] [Update 3: Assassin's Creed - Rogue runs at clean 60 fps locked with everything in 'Very High preset'. I was also able to push my resolution to 3840 X 2160 as seen in the above pic although I have to inform, it results in screen flickers. Switching it to 2560 X 1440 makes it smooth at 42-45 fps] [Update 4: Watch Dogs runs at 43-50 fps in most settings in ultra with anti-aliasing off on a resolution of 1920 X 1080 at 120 Hz. I found out that putting the resolution at 2K leads to Refresh Rate dropping to 60 Hz I guess unlike Assassin's Creed - Rogue which can maintain 120 Hz. Ghost Recon: Wildlands and Medal of Honor: Warfighter results are coming soon] [Update 5: Ghost Recon: Wildlands is a game that's pretty demanding and in Medium to High, I go around 39-45 (Medium) and 30-40 ish(High) with some stuttering with random fps drops to 6-10 for like 2-5 seconds.] [Update 6: Haven't tried Medal of Honor: Warfighter yet but did play Assassin's Creed - Syndicate in Medium/High and got around 40-50 fps. NFS Payback ran at 40-50 fps on Medium/High again. Tried Sleeping Dogs for old school's sake and hit 120-125 fps Maxed out (the title is optimised for AMD or something). Stay tuned for more.] Also you get a nice keyboard with good key travel (nothing great) with RGB (All zone and not per key). Only issue I had (easy fix so not worth a minus star) - AURA doesn't work with Armoury Crate so you can uninstall the software and the UWP interface, download the software from ASUS site and then install the Armoury Crate from Microsoft Store and try again (TBH, it didn't work even after that). Or else, download TUF Aura Core from Microsoft Store (make sure you have the AURA SDK installed) then it will work just fine. [Update 1: The Armoury Crate works, just search through the menus to find a subsection called System and there you can disable Background apps and also set lighting, good job ASUS üôÉ] For the music producers out there: FL 20 runs smooth with Multiple instances of Serum opening and playing back smoothly, FabFilter, Isotope etc all in one project with lots of tracks. (Just don't go overboard and it will manage) Tried Affinity Photo and that too runs great (I like Adobe Photoshop CC but since the apps are getting buggy, I've decided to switch to the next best thing.) Haven't tried DaVinci Resolve (again Adobe ü•∫) will update this section soon Hope my review helps and upvote if it does. P.S: If you wonder how I keep my fps high, just keep your laptop filled with things and software you will use and and it will work just fine. Anymore doubts? Reply to this review (Can we reply tho?)"

160262,mobile,This phone has not been given basics which is battery and 3.5mm jack. After using this phone for a month I feel like left alone from this world. It's like a beautiful building on a very weak foundation. How many pictures would you click when you have serious battery issues. I normally don't write reviews but this phone has pissed me off. It's my fault that I didn't read the reviews before buying this. Thanks to the last time of Diwali sale
118370,mobile,Bought it for 800 around. I have iPhone 6 Plus and I am usually out all day and needed a power backup. I decided on this seeing that it is from mi and trusted the brand for its air purifier. However I am disappointed by the performance. It takes a LONG time to charge and it hardly charges my phone 2 times. Not even complete second time. My earlier power bank was so much better. Also it doesn‚Äôt have the digital display to tell exact charge left in the power bank. If we are compromising on a feature I expect a better capacity/quality. So I would suggest to go for another power bank.

157002,mobile,"The amoled screen of Samsung M30s is very delicate. It can be broken and the complete phone can be dead on slight drop. AMOLED displays can crack and go completely black after seemingly minor damage, or in some cases, no apparent damage at all. In comparision to this the LCD screens seem to be able to survive much more serious damage.AMOLED screen tends to go black (so customers have no choice but to pay for a pricey repair) and LCDs tend to still be usable most of the time (so customers can choose to postpone the repair until prices go down and keep using their broken screen with a screen protector on top). I have recently purchased this phone whose screen got completely damaged on slight drop. I have replaced the screen on 01.11.2019 for Rs. 4000/-, and the authorised servicing centre has also charged Rs. 413/- extra towards labour cost even within one month of purchase. Why to charge labour cost in warranty period ?"

133114,refrigerator,"Hello, I'm a casual nature photographer and here is my quick review on Nikon D5300. I started my photography hobby with Nikon D3200 and got familiar in a month. Its the best dslr camera for beginners to get started into photography field. Meanwhile I bought two lenses, Nikon AF-S 55-200mm for bird photography and AF-S 35mm for general photography. Both of these lenses are good and sharp. After 2 years, I felt the need of upgrade because D3200 had some lacking features as given below and 200mm was short for bird photography. I sold it last month and bought this Nikon D5300 Dual Lens Kit from JJ Mehta. This is a wonderful camera and fulfills all my present requirements. It feels sturdy in hands and buttons are easy to operate. UI is user friendly and straightforward. Screen is slightly warmer but pleasant to view photos in the day and night. Compared to my previous dslr, this one has improved image sensor, 2,016 pixels exposure metering sensor, 4800DX AF system, EXPEED 4 image processor, no AA filter, lesser shutter lag and etc. Hence its more powerful and takes much better photos. Nikon AF-P 18-55mm and 70-300mm lenses take sharp photos from end to end focal length and wide open. The new AF-P technology is very fast in focusing, accurate and silent. Also there was no issues focusing in low light situations whereas my other AF-S lenses struggle big time. The focus ring is electronic so its very smooth and precise but only works when the camera is ON. In other words, focus ring is connected to AF motor and that moves the lens elements. Unfortunately both the lenses have different filter size (55mm and 58mm respectively) so I had to buy two different size MC-UV filters for them. Here is the list of features that I find very helpful and the same were lacking in D3200. 1. Framing grid in viewfinder. Helpful for products photography. 2. Auto ISO display in viewfinder. ISO sensitivity can be seen in viewfinder before the taking shot. 3. 39 AF points, 9 of them are cross type. With AF-P lens, its superfast and accurate. 4. Wide range of ISO sensitivity selection. i.e 100, 125, 160, 200, 250 & so on. 5. Adjustable compensation values for minimum shutter speed in Auto ISO. i.e Slower, slow, normal, fast, faster. 6. Low and high continuous release modes. Helpful for bird photography. 7. Give rating for photos within the camera. 8. Custom my menu list. I can add useful settings in that list so I don't have to search in main list. 9. Built-in Wifi. I can use qDslrDashboard app to take photos from my smartphone without a wire connection. Tested and works fine. 10. Last but not least, the articulated screen. I'm not really a fan of it but it is indeed helpful sometimes. Finally, I would highly recommend this camera to amateur photographers. Even beginners can go for it instead of D3XXX so there is no need to upgrade early."

I purchased the laptop from a local dealer and it came with Windows and MS Office pre-installed. This laptop is just phenomenal. It is good for working on OneNote, Word, basic coding, emails, anything! Great performance. They keyboard is so snappy! You really feel a drive of pleasure when you tap in the keys, unlike the unwelcoming painful bump your fingers receive while typing on apple's ""butterfly"" keyboard. I am very satisfied with the purchase. I have written a thesis, multiple research papers, emails, and whatnot on this very laptop! OneNote has become the reservoir of all my notes so now I'm not scared about bad handwriting or losing my notes. I'm happier than ever! The fingerprint sensor works like a breeze. The front facing camera and the mic aren't very top notch but the mic bit can be fixed via a headset."

134059,refrigerator,I am writing this review after using this product for 2 days Its a good product with a nyc display It has a nice connectivity It automatically connects when you turn on the bluetooth of your phone It gives notification for evry whatsapp fb text messages You can use for camera remote to take photos on selfie stick when connected Talking about the battery it has a huge battery backup I charged it fully on the day of delivery and after 2 days of use it is still left with 82% charge It also give u option for workout modes You can select according to your requirement Overall a great product at a great price I am loving it
147730,mobile,Not upto the mark.Quality of the built products like back case and all are not good.I am using samsung from many years.But when i saw the quality or the material used for this phone i was really shocked.Just to compete samsung compromised in the quality. Which is really bad.I am very much disappointed with this phone quality.

135665,smartTv,I like bass of this led tv is very good . But the vocals and dialogue not clear low level volume. But in high is volume is very good . No need extra speaker or some things else. Picture quality is very good. It's OS is very good by LG company. For normal room sound quality is good. And magic good even in next room. But magic remote consume battery more as we compare to normal remote I think because of Bluetooth connectivity.

I wanted to gift a phone to my papa but then i was a little bit tipsy abput samsung, but seriously guys samsung has come back into competetion and this is the best phone that i have brought for Rs16,999. Thanks samsung for winning my confidence once again. Ill tell you pros and cons of this phone : Pros : 1.Excellent Display 2. Too light 3. Battery backup 4. Supports HD streaming 5. Dedicated card slot 6. USB Type-C port and fast charging Cons : 1. No notifocation light 2. Plastic body but i guess thats what stores the 6000mah beast inside else it might become heavy with metallic body. 3. No case cover in the box. In total this is the best purchase among all the phones that i have brought till date."

163792,refrigerator,"Very gud product at reasonable price..energy saving,instant cooling sysyltem.üëç"
110154,mobile,"1. Body is made of plastic which makes it quality inferior and does not give it a premium look like other Samsung phones 2. NFC is no future technology and missing it in a latest phone does make it lack at some point 3. Face unlock is not faster and effective 4. Speed/ Proceesor - Exynos won't give more effective speed when you are using multiple apps opened in parallel, in that way you always need to go with snapdragon. 5. Camera is just okay"
158112,mobile,"The phone is nice. The display is wonderful. Battery is comparatively better, still we can't rely on it that much. If we are using internet, game, camera etc., then it drains out as other phones do. But in normal use, we get more life than other phones. So I will not say the battery life is super, but definitely it is better. I am having the 4gb varient. It is not working so fast eventhough I have not installed many applications (memory is almost free). I feel a lag in the processing sometimes. I am concerned about what will happen if I start to use more and heavy apps.. Since I am using a Samsung phone for the first time, I miss some facilities I enjoyed in my old redmi phone, like 1)a good inbuilt music player 2)Showing the network connectivity speed in the status bar 3)unavailability of missed call imformation in the lock screen. (We have to unlock the phone and then launch the 'Phone' application to know who had made the call). etc. Heating is there. A phone with this much memory and processor and also having an amoled display, I didn't expected that. But it can't be considered as a major issue as it is not severe. Still, it is there when you use camera or internet for long time. Camera is excellent in day light photography. The video quality and dim light operations are not that excellent. Though these problems exists, I enjoy the phone. I suggest a normal phone user to go for it, as the problems I mentioned will not affect them, and the quality of display, sound, camera etc. in this price will definitly make you love it."
140552,mobile,"Its front cam is awesome...flagship level...but firstly its rear cam is average...not so bad but After update rear cam has huge difference, it quality looks good especially hdr+supervivid mode, its work like pro cam . Its battery life is awesome as not expected from 3500mah due to helio p70 based on 12nm technology. Its gaming experience is awesome..perform like smooth butter....overall it is best budget smartphone...realme works great.."

Camera : Rear and front camera is good but not best. Needs to improve. Specially low light condition it performs bad. For photography I suggest to buy Realme XT or wait for Resmi Note 8 Pro for budget segment. Screen : sAmoled display fHD+ is great to view videos, playing games and touch also best. Battery : For my opinion battery backup is best. You can use it whole day in one charge with heavy usages. It also support fast charge. Approximately 3 hours to take full charge. Overall this device is good."

149744,mobile,"Overall performance of M30, with regard to the quality of display and battery life, is excellent. However following areas need improvement: Sound quality for music, particularly for playing classical music, is disappointing, as compared to earlier devices (Nokia and Motorola) I was using For watching video films, if I hold the device in my left hand, often when my finger touches the volume / on-off buttons, the film stops abruptly and previous page appears - then I have to resume watching again. As a result most of the time (1 to 2 hrs) I need to hold the device in my right hand. I think the spacing of the top buttons need some adjustment. An additional feature, to have a foldable stand on the back side, or at least provide a cover with such facility would greatly help watching films. Initial photos with camera in auto mode did not meet my expectations - perhaps I have to study use of camera in more detail. Otherwise, I would say M30 is the best smart phone in its range."
133108,mobile,"Hello guys, I bought SAMSUNG M30s in the great Indian sale on 29th Oct. The delivery from Amazon was quick -I received my phone on the next evening. To be Frank I had decided to purchase RealMe 5 Pro and was waiting for the sale to go live. As I was about to order, my friend asked me to check out M30s. To my surprise M30s was a complete package with a SAMSUNG brand. And I went ahead and order it right away. I am writing this feedback after 7 days (I have done Durga puja trip with this phone) All positives from the phone so far. 1) Great camera 2) Great display (though I was not fan of this but it does give a feel of One plus at such budget) 3) Good processing so far (received 2-3) updates 4) Audio is also good On the not great experience so far 1) Charging takes asome time (though it's a huge battery) 2) 2) Also not sure about the 6000mah battery because it didn't come to me like one Apart from this there are differences in usage from my previous mobile phones and hence commenting on them would be early and naive of me!"
151684,mobile,Probably the best priced phone available in this category with all features loaded. Add to that the great processing size (4GB) and you have the best phone in this price range. No frills added phone with the capability to do much more.

121000,refrigerator,Don't expect to have an easy image like your mobile phone..if you are a beginner you need to learn to operate it
141840,mobile,Like: Mobile has good screen size and good display quality.Look wise phone is very good. Fast charging as it's type C charger. Dislike: No headphone provided which is now in all phones It has triple rear camera but it takes time to capture snap. This phone has 6 GB RAM but perfomance wise not much difference with 4GB RAM other mobiles One major problem I see is mobile network signal strength is also weak it takes time when I call someone then after 30 second some dialer tone will come. Not sure this is because of Idea network issue in pune or because of mobile.
120497,mobile,Device is awesome but battery drains very fast... Need any update for battery r else can't able to use as primary phone....

135953,mobile accessories,"I like this phone. Initially i was having some doubts with the face id, like if it works under low light etc. But it works flawlessly even in utter darkness as well. Totally happy with this XR"
156467,smartTv,Surely better than other Chinese Brands and fairly priced.
111455,mobile accessories,"After using Samsung M30 for 15 days I could say it's an amazing mobile for this price point. I had gone with this model seeing 6GB RAM, 128GB storage and 5000mAH battery and it lived my expectations. I went to my office in the morning at 8:30 A.M with 30% of battery and with some nominal calls not much usage checking watsapp now and then, I returned home with my mobile still have 19% to go with. Pros: So here are things why you should go with this mobile. 1. Decent space 128GB lets you download many apps without giving any ""storage space running out"" errors. Already installed many apps but still have lot of space. 2. Camera is lot more natural compared to other makers who make you look more fairer. But not to expect such fake charisma. You could enjoy a natural and decent camera. Don't forget to say hi to your camera it let's you take your photo automatically. 3.Battery to me hasn't disappointed instead it surprised me for a superb extra life. Remember an extra save when we play temple run. 5000mAH is really a beast and all those battery lovers can go for this mobile. 4. You want to hide some personal pictures of yours. Don't worry you can delete them and find them safe in recycle bin. Yeah no need of 3rd party folder lock apps or Samsung Knox. All you need to do is simply delete from your gallery and intruders who browse your gallery won't find your personals but it's still there in your recycle bin. If you have mistakenly deleted your gallery items don't worry you have recycle bin to your rescue. If you want to permanently delete then you need to delete in Recycle bin. 5. Glitch free, fast and smooth performance for any popular games like subway surfers, Temple fun and candy crush. Havent tried PUBG, but might run well too. 6GB Ram and processor let's you have a smooth and skating performance. 6. Android pie out of the box and what else you need. Lock screen stories feature is really awesome, every time you press the unlock button you will find a new lock screen story with HD resolution pictures which let's your mobile look pro in front of your co workers or co passengers. 7. Descent fingerprint reader, unlocks nicely with just your finger tap else lock screen code will also do the magic. 8. Look of the phone is also superb with a large screen and rounded edges. Cons: 1. Samsung M30 phone bit heavy, not a bad reason for phone buyer to consider yet most of the phones these days are light weight. 2. Box is devoid of headset which is just a turn off for those Samsung ear phone lovers. You are spending way too much for these many features, why not add a small head set to the accessories list. Samsung should have had placed a headset. (Solution: If you have your old Samsung phones ear phones then it'll do the work, I'm using my old earphones of Samsung Note3 Neo) 3. The charger wire is so short. Is it a cost cutting feature Samsung thought of? Should have increased price a hundred bucks more and have placed a lengthy wire. How many smart phone users travel in cars these days? People like me travel in trains where we need to put the charger in the plugpin and phone in the bag hung on the hanger but wire is too short. (Solution charge your phone in home only and need not worry in trains, battery won't let you down) Not to consider these flaws much, but to me I have got a decent, good looking and a beautiful performer for this price tag. Hope my honest review would help you decide whether to buy this phone or not."
136069,mobile accessories,I liked the device because 1.The ram management is good. 2.Battery lasts a full working day. 3.Design is superb in this range. 4.Rear & front camera catches pictures with very good details. 5.Speaker quality is adequate. 6.Earpiece is vv good. 7.Calls on speaker is an awesome experience.
114595,mobile,Awesome product in budget price... Really loved it But one minus thing is front 5 mp camera Except those the awesome mobile.. Back camera portrait shots are superbbb performance...

119057,mobile,"Camera is just superb and a lot better than it's competitors. The image is processed nicely by the processor. sAMOLED screen with Full HD display is the just turn on. You can easily feel the difference against later LCD displays. 6000mAH battery, Well one thing you don't have to worry about is the battery life of this phone. Gaming is super smooth with the new Exynos 9611 processor."

I solved this by connecting a Lan wire directly from the wifi router."
150569,mobile accessories,Phone is good..
138456,mobile,It is a great phone for the price. The camera is beautiful. Gaming is ok. Pubg mobile works fine with no lag issues. The UI is stock android so it is fluidic and efficient. Con - battery backup could have been better but since the phone has so many features so it makes up for it.

When taking about answering a call this earphones are good becoz of the reduction of the surrounding noise and it also enhance the voice through the mic. I think the modal of the jack is pretty old ..and also the wire is sometimes getting tangled if it is not kept properly... .. these 2 problems were solved this earphone will be much better.... But even with these problems this earphone is better when compared to the other earphones of this price...."

159169,mobile,"Things to like for this phone: 1. Monster battery and excellent battery life. 6000 mAh is just soo powerful and effective. The quick charger charges the phone faster than you can think. 2. No lag or hanging of phone even if multiple applications are in the background.( I've run over 15 in the background ) 3. Front as well as Rear camera are doing ga WOW! job even in low lighting or artificial lighting. 4. Screen and the Fingerprint Reader response time is just SO QUICK! 5. The back of the phone is of supreme quality and does not make the slip off the hands of the user. 6. There's no hybrid sim slot. So, you can use 2 nano sims and 1 micro SD card at the same time. (Many Redmi phones miss out this feature). 7. The phone has a lot of options for the ease of access to the user such as gestures, and what not. 8. The camera also has many options such as super slo-mo video, slo-mo video, panorama, wide angle photo, night mode, etc. There's also a super stability mode for videography which makes the video real stable. Only thing to dislike about this phone is that it does not have any protection but you'll receive acko screen protection for 1 year (I've got it) anyway. So it balances it out. Even though the phone won't slip out easily even if you have a loose grip. Overall inspection of the phone proves it as one of the best phone to purchase this 2019. I hope this review did good to the one who is thinking of buying the phone."

159739,smartTv,This is luxury every person like to have. After using IPhone 6 Plus I bought this Jet black colour which is great. All are rumour to give Samsung Galaxy 7 edge as best smartphone with the specs it has but in my view IPhone 7 plus is clear winner because of following reasons:- 1) Brilliant screen display 2) Best storage capacity. I am having 256 Gb. This is needed for 4K video recording so just shoot n relax rather than worried about memory 3) Phone never hangs till now neither my earlier phone does I.e. iPhone 6 Plus 4) camera is brilliant n you can take clear picture n low light also. Portrait mode is wonderful. 5) Airpods will make one more feather on iPhone as it will be best thing 6) IOS make brilliant compare to android as now nogut 7.1 is available then how many androids have this on but iPhone 10.1.1 is available for every iPhone user than to wait for android user 7) The sound of phone is very clear n crystal. Listening music with earpods make your experience enriching.

133386,mobile,"Honestly speaking, there is nothing I disliked about the incredible smartphone from Samsung launched recently, it is phenomenal in performance and enhanced my experience. The triple camera, videography (slow-mo, super slow-mo, hyperlapse); features have stunned me & I'm fully surprised to get this medium budget high-end smartphone with robust performance. The extraordinary battery of 6000mAH is icing on the cake along with features like Full HD, dual SIM 4G smartphone with some cool pre-loaded factory apps are simply great. The speed of Samsung's own processor through tight integration with hardware, 6GB memory & 128 GB storage are inevitably awesome as utility in this high data driven world and I'm feeling proud, confident & elated by owning this phone, I'll strongly recommend everyone out on the street to go for Samsung Galaxy M30s without fail. This is definitely and inevitably better than all other brands in this category of specifications and beat others in all aspects. During this Diwali, this will go as Cracker Bomb to boost my swagger and make my Diwali more entertaining with family and friends."

112337,mobile,Amazing phone at this price point. There's little bit lag with camera but i hope they will fix this issue in their upcoming phone updates. Otherwise i use this phone for my office use and the battery lasts for a day which no other cellphone i used did till date. Gaming experience: Gaming experience is excellent with my 6GB version and the display unit is just out of the world.

Talking abt problem. build quality is not so good. Compare to other mob. Available in market. *Must have provided back cover/screen protector with mob.

166820,mobile,Writing this review after using this device for more than a week. I would jot down my points in pros and cons. Pros :- 1. A decent battery life. It's better than others cause it's a 6000 mah battery. 4/5 2. Display is superb thanks to the super amoled screen it offers. 5/5 3. Multi tasking is okay not that I would say completely satisfied. But it does the job. 4/5 4. Yup you can play games hassle free. 4/5 Cons :- 1. THE BIGGEST CON OR I MUST SAY DECEIVING FACT ABOUT THIS PHONE IS THE 48MP CAMERA ITS SAYS IT IS OFFERINGS. THIS IS THE LIE OF THE YEAR. THE CAMERA IS NOWHERE NEAR 48MP BUT IT IS A 8 MP CAMERA. IF YOU ARE A PHOTO ENTHUSIAST DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MOBILE. 1/5 2. SOUND IS ALSO NOT GOOD. THEY HAVE COMPROMISED IN THIS FEATURE AS WELL. 2/5 3. NO NOTIFICATION FEATURE. IF THE PHONE IS LOCKED YOU WOULD NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY NOTIFICATION OR ANY MISSED CALLS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THANKS FOR READING. HOPE THIS HELPS.

So far experience is good, but in the starting level fingerprint reader has taken time to read but after use it's working good and facelock is awesome. Yes, there is no doubt picture quality is wow. I yet not sure about battery life because I'm not using mobile so much but I think 4030 mha battery would be better for this phone. If you want to purchase this I would suggest go for that."

152718,mobile,"Quick Review: Pros: 1) 6000mah battery is the coolest feature of this phone. 2) Rear cameras are pretty impressive. But there is just single flash. In night photoshoot you'll miss dual flash. 3) Design is awesome. 4) Latest Android update. 5) Screen is smooth. 6) RAM, ROM and processor are enough to play heavy games like pubg, call of duty. Cons: 1) Finishing is not good. 2) Front Camera is so bad even below average. I didn't like it. 3) Heating issue even on call."

116058,mobile accessories,Battery life very poor Phone performance very poor
143520,mobile,"My point of view after using the phone for 3 days - Display is the best part of the phone - CPU is good enough for multimedia experience, I don't play games so I'm quite satisfied with the performance, it's comparable to Snapdragon 665 (the cores A73 and A53 are old, should have used A75 and A55), the only advantage Exynos 9611 has over Snapdragon 665, 675, 710/712 is that it uses four high performance cores(A73) than two on SDs but SDs use newer A75 or A76 cores for high performance and A55 for lower tiers. - Battery: For me lasted for around 1.5 days after moderate use, was expecting a better performance, charging speed is disappointing, phone should have supported 20W+ fast charging. As with any other phones, the battery endurance would go down as time progresses, so in a long term, expect 1 day backup. - Loudspeaker is not so audible and clear, you can get better sounding phones in similar price segment, but I don't use loudspeakers much so I'm okay with it. - Audio output through headphone jack is good but could've been better, volume is a bit low, (Tested with SoundMagic E11C with Powermap music player and Dolby Atoms enabled), wireless audio quality is average (this is where Snapdragons truly excel with their aptX codecs) - Battery drains faster than expected when Always-On is enabled. - Camera quality: Very disappointing camera performance, photos are not as sharp but colors are natural. Wide angle photo comes badly with barrel distortion around the edges. Video recordings are good (normal and wide), super stead is great. Very poor low-light performance (both video and stills), poor front-facing camera quality, I'm hoping it's not a hardware defect but a software issue and will be fixed in future update(s), I have seen better photos in various video reviews than what I'm getting. - Network reception is poor, even older phones have better reception than this, But it could be a result of low SAR value.. - Fingerprint: slower than competitors, sometimes it fails to detect and unlock, another drawback is that only 3 fingerprints can be registered. - Call quality: Voice clarity could've been better but it's quite loud, disappointingly the sound leaks through the back-panel (around fingerprint scanner, can also feel the sound vibrations) if the volume is set to high, so a person sitting next to you can hear the person on call. - OneUI - UI is light weight and looks good, Night(dark) mode is really great, but needs more features, I would like to have data speed shown in status bar. Split screen view is not available, should also include app-lock feature. Hope much of the issues gets fixed through updates. tl:dr; If your requirement is majorly web surfing, multimedia, good batter backup, phone calls, then it's a good phone for this target audience. Not for high performance users, gamers and photography."

122464,mobile,"Excellent features. Absolutely a beast. I am enjoying all the way. Flagship mobile features In this price segment. Just blindly go for it. Camera: The rear and front camera quality is great, night mode is good enough to capture good shots. Additional zoom-out features for both front and rear camera is nice to have. Select 48 MP in camera mode to take a beautiful picture Battery: I am really happy with the monster battery. I am not a heavy gamer. But professionally use GPS heavily. Backup lasts up to approx 2 days. Yes, approx 48 hours with good usage of WiFi and GPS. Gyro and Magnetic sensors are awesome. Design, Touch, Look & Feel is awesome and even though it has a 6000mAh battery, it feels light. The face recognition is also quick to sense and unlock. The processing speed is good enough for heavy games without much heating effect. Grab It , Use it and enjoy........."
110450,mobile,"720p?? Ok, let's break it down. iPhones are for iOS users, not for android lovers -------------------------------------------------------- I lost my iPhone 7 recently and was using an android device in the mean time. Few years back I switched to iPhone after using my motoG, moto X1, moto X2 for 3 years. Personally I like the simplicity and fluidity of iOS. Not a huge fan of how android handles the files and too much customization in a mobile device is a big NO for me. Only thing I truly miss in iOS is integration of google services in OS layer. iCloud, apple maps and any other apple cloud service, you name it, it sucks. iOS‚Äôs approach of get the stuff done without much input from user is what I really admire. I would love to buy something like OneP or Pixel. But it is android that I have the problem with, not the hardware. I own a Macbook, iPad, AppleTV (You can call me a fanboy but I just found them to be better devices for my requirements. Kidneys still intact :D), Apple Ecosystem is second to none. If you have Android devices and Windows PCs at home, then iPhone experience will not be that enticing. iPhones should be compared to other iPhones, not fair to compare with android devices who use an Open source OS and a less/non restrictive app store that helps in keeping the price low. The Good things about this device ---------------------------------------- 1) Coming to this device, I will start with the display. IT IS BEAUTIFUL. May be I switched from from iPhone 7, thats why. Comparing side by side with Oled display of OneP 6, I barely see a difference in naked eye. In fact my friend thought it is an oled panel at first. For what it is worth, I can say the display is no where near iPhone Xs or Note 9. But you won‚Äôt know unless you compare it side by side. Wanting a not so well calibrated 1080p than this colour accurate 820p lcd is like preferring Oppo‚Äôs 24mp camera over the Pixel 3‚Äôs 12mp camera. I can say this display is definitely better than iPhone 8plus 1080p. It is bright, colour accurate and has nice viewing angles. 2) Camera and Performance 10/10. I don‚Äôt miss dual lens at all. Again, may be because I am switching from single lens mobile and I have a DSLR. 3) Face id can be trusted. I have ptosis in one eye and also I wear glasses. Still no issue so far. Touch id seems dated now. 4) I am surprised that apple is providing A12, though they could have provided A11. I prefer a better processor to a better display any day. 5) I feel it is a no brainer to go for Xr than Going for X or Xs/Xs Max. Only if you really want an apple flagship. If android is your choice then there are many awesome devices. 6) Battery. It is a beast when it comes to battery life. I can say battery life is approximately 2 times of what I was getting on iPhone 7. Bad things about this device --------------------------------- 1) About price you already know, it is overpriced. But no other iOS alternatives to this at this point. The whole tech community need to understand that it is 2018. Not a hardware game anymore. It is all about user experience, security, reliability and better SW(Google is absolutely killing it with SW but they are still very bad players of the HW game. Ask me about Pixel devices, they should be price almost half). I would have preferred A11 processor and last year Camera in this device with a 16,000 rupees price cut. 2) For me a well built 820p display is OK. But a 76k device and no fast charger? No dongles? Seriously that is Greedy from Apple's part. That is where I think they are taking advantage of loyal iOS users. 3) No Plans like apple care/protection in India like USA. Repairing these new iPhones are gonna cost you bombs. I highly recommend this device. 8.5/10 from me. Would have given 9 if a fast charger was included in the box. 9.5 if price is 65k. Apple needs to consider about the tax/pricing structure applied to apple devices in India. It is not a great feeling for me to buy this one instead of something like OneP 6T. But sadly, that is not an iOS device."

128688,mobile,Good one
123203,mobile,"Except the color, handset is excellent in terms of performance"
159538,smartTv,"This is a great tablet with some brilliant features and a few flaws. The good things about this tablet include the screen, which is full HD and looks absolutely gorgeous when used to watch videos and playing games. The 16:10 aspect ratio also means it is great for productivity and dual screen apps. The SoC is Snapdragon 625, which is the best for moderate performance and good battery life. The battery is however small and battery life is decent at best. The worst part about the tablet for me is the fingerprint sensor. It is integrated into the power button, which makes accessing the power button a bit hard as it is recessed. And the finger print sensor doesn't work all the time. It gave me about 60% success rate, which is very bad as the side position means it constantly gets in the way when I am holding the tablet. Overall this is a great tablet, but if you don't have much use for that SD 625 or the screen, just buy the regular Lenovo Tab4 8, which will also save you a bit of money."
152253,mobile accessories,Product was good but behaviour of company was worst towards customer. No one pick help line number. If your product have any problem no one reple you. Or most of earphones have problems.

No heating at all. 7. Design is premium. Cons: 1. Camera could have been better lighting is little less and night mode is not included therefore it can‚Äôt take good night photos. ( Portrait mode only available for humans) 2. Display is good but it is not the best in the price range. 3. No 3d touch.

139666,mobile accessories,It's display is not working within 3 months but in service centre I have to pay for this display replacement within gareentee period
157080,mobile,"The battery life was horrible. I was able to charge my 3000mah phone only one time. The power bank got discharged completely. Also, while I took the power bank the seal.of the box was opened."
138390,mobile,It have a good appearance. Black body gives the phone an astonishing appearance. Fingerprint is as quick as redmi phones. Battery life is Affordable. Only one day battery. Camera is good but after Updation it's getting dark.screen is clear and perfect for videos and pictures. Processor is good overall it is quite convincing our expectations..
165190,refrigerator,"Well it depends on what you need it for. *For tracking steps through out the day? It does a good job tracking steps, but it's useless if you don't put efforts to increase your steps based on the information. *For tracking distance while running, if this is your only use, you have many apps to do this job. *For heart rate tracking, for a normal person this is unnecessary data again, as far as I know. *For getting notifications from phone, well I'm not using this as you have turn on your Bluetooth in phone and this reduces battery life of phone. And also phone is almost always in my hands. *Sleep tracking, I'm not sure how accurate this is. Anyway I'm not using this too as it's a little uncomfortable to wear it while sleeping, as I keep my hands under head while sleeping. Also, again if you don't put efforts to improve based on the information, its no use again. I think I have covered major features, now coming to performance. Battery life is good, without continous heart rate tracking and without connecting to mobile for notifications, it lasted for 1month in single full charge. Display is ok ok, little difficult to ch eck time in sunlight. One shortcoming is, both my bands don't turn on sometimes when I raise my wrist to check time. Looks good and durable. I feel I don't need it though."

132728,mobile accessories,HI GUYS This phone packs a lotta punch for its price with some pros and cons i'll guide you through my experience. Being a heavy social media user uploading stories through this phone is smooth as we all know Instagram prefers Iphone to upload smooth stories this phone legit comes at par with that smoothness and with microphone being the best level to record with that smoothness. Camera is pretty good with wide angle lens with the pack you can shoot more than what you need to and cons for the camera are lack of electronic image stabilization and depth and colour accuracy however many users wont actually notice it VERY VERY BIG BATTERY with 5000 Mah on the pack its more than what you need and with 15 watt type C charger its ultra fast to charge the device .the devices could be left whole day without charge if its on a full charge It does lag on multitasking as it uses exynos 7904 bit less in performance that snapdragon but in the form factor its fits in perfectly DISPLAY is very crisp and having high screen to body ratio it feels big in hand and feel The security in this phone is bit laggy if you use fingerprint scanner and its prone to get dirty and the facial recognition is not upto the mark The speakers are bottom firing and is pretty decent with built in dobly atmos for headphone users its pretty crazy OVERALL its a great phone in this price point however if you could punch in little more money get the next model because of the camera
160047,mobile,This is the worst service of Amazon..no return request is accepted and totally face costume service of Amazon..

158684,mobile,"The ram management is not that good. I think it's because of the colour os. It needs improvement.. and the front cam is superb, just the portrait edge detection needs improvement. But the back cam needs more details and optimisation to give a proper finish in a photo."
134943,refrigerator,"I got this one for Rs. 28,500 and I must tell you, the quality of the images are amazing.. Post processing is amazing.. Highly recommended for amateurs like who have just begun to have a hands-on"

165366,mobile,"What you see above is my Iphone X, previously i have used many other Iphones including SE, 6 and all, but this one ""oh my god "" this one is giving me so much headache it started before 2 months when my Iphone freezed for a period of 15 minutes and i was not even able to restart the device and after some times it resumed the activity. Before a few days the 3D touch was not functioning well and after talking with the adviser from apple i restarted the network settings and the 3D touch problem was solved but at night the problem resumed. Today one side of the phone suddenly changed its color by about 11 am and the whole screen is glitching on its own. I had so much of faith in you Iphone X, as i was a fan boy i didn't mind about the freezing because glitches are usual and now one of the costliest phone is malfunctioning by a lot i don't know what to say - Speechless"

165150,mobile,"Well , I received it the next day which is wonderful. Nice packaging and all but the product.. It feels good. It looks but it doesn't work good. The sound quality is average , when I tried different equalizers through my phone or pc I couldn't find any difference between this ‚Çπ600 earphones and free Samsung earphones. The fitting it nice and easy and comfy but the sound the bass are disappointing. I prefer to raise your budget and buy sennheiser products. They will always amaze you"

I use it only to read PDFs and to watch movies and some browsing. But i can not even perform these small works perfectly. It takes a lot of time to open browser.5_10 minutes. It hangs a lot. You can buy, but believe me, you will regret. Rest, you wish."

124551,mobile,"Front camera is awesome, but the back camera sucks. If you want a decent phone under 15k with good selfie cam, water drop notch and smooth gaming performance. Then go for it. If u dnt hv a budget issue, jst go from one plus 6t üòÅ"

151484,refrigerator,Poor tray quality.
140824,mobile,It‚Äôs a beautiful phone. I have rose gold. Snappy performance and good fast responsive camera. Super slippery so it‚Äôs best used with a protective case. Screen protector is not essential if you are careful not putting it your purse or pocket with other stuff like keys / coins. Battery life could be an issue for heavy users.

111518,smartTv,"After using this TV for a week, below are my observations - Screen is HD (720p) so if you watch from 4-5 feet distsnce, picture quality should be okay - Speakers are not the best I have heard, but does the job. Does not distort at higher volumes. - Takes some time to boot. So if you are used to non-andriod tvs, booting time can seem longer - Remote is bluetooth, so very easy to use. Voice search feature on remote works great."
119012,mobile,"Camera is decent, selfie is not good. Processor is good for general use but GPU is weak hence gaming is not much better. Battery life and display quality is awesome. Build quality is not good, plastic back feels very thin on pressing."
122878,smartTv,"Excellent product for 5669/- (with bank discount) , bought during the freedom sale."
115381,smartTv,Battery back is very bad. Only 1 h 30 m playback.
154341,mobile accessories,Sleep tracking and data display on the app are awesome. All sensors seem to be accurate. Notifications and music control will work as long as your phone doesn't kill the huawei health app from the background(You might want to tweak the settings for the same). Battery lasts a week with sleep tracking on and real time heart rate monitoring off. So not that bad in that department too. Go for it if you want a fitness band that does the job that it's supposed to do even at this price.
157414,mobile accessories,"The camera quality is below average. The Redmi Note 7s, which comes around 13k has better camera resolution. No slow motion too. One UI is good, no ads. But too many crappy Samsung apps."

121133,smartTv,"Don‚Äôt worry, the product is genuine. Phone is as good as they come, a quality piece to say the least. No audio jack is a positive in my opinion, the phone looks good without it. Been using this for more than 2 weeks now and found no heating problem with heavy gaming whatsoever like so many of you experienced. Just check the basics whether the product is genuine or not and you‚Äôre good. Goodluck!"

About the phone there is no way to say phone hanging while using multiple applications . Excellent camera quality, audio (head phone also) ,smooth operation and display. Only drawback is Battery life, If moderate user can withstand upto 9hrs per per day. Mobil charging will take 2hr from zero level"

116807,smartTv,"Best budget all-rounder under 10,000 price category. It covers all basics and essential requirements beautifully and camera performance is acceptable while considering the category. Battery life is great and you can even use it for one and a half days on moderate use. It's not meant for those who want heavy performance. It's a jack of all trades, you can't go wrong with this purchase."

138424,smartTv,It is a defective product.
170560,mobile,"when you first look the phone it seems very pretty but performance wise i don't like this phone. 1 the 5 megapixel front camera for selfies is a tiny bit unsatisfactory and leaves it for improvement. 2 even though you may not find any particular heating issues, it may seem that the redmi 6 pro stutters slightly while playing heavy games. 3 it does not support fast charging. 4 face unlock works efficiently in low light which is a significant security concern since anyone maybe capable of unlocking your phone. 5 Weight wise 178gm which is slightly heavy as compared to other phone in the same price range and of same battery size. One thing i really like and appreciate mi for notification light. i love that notification light."
165383,mobile,When I first installed it on my phone it says memory card is corrupted then i formatted the card and it's working ok.read speed is good but write speed is slow.

117209,smartTv,"Best iphone till date, 7 is better than 8"
168723,smartTv,"iPhone is now considered a fashion accessory and can easily be compared with expensive jewelry and purses. Apple has changed its design for the iPhone 7 if minor changes in the camera rim are considered. Though the smartphone industry is moving towards larger screens, Apple still cares for its loyal customers who prefer a small and portable device. Let us walk through the different features of this phone and decide whether it is a worthy upgrade from the previous generations. **** NEW HOME BUTTON 1. The new capacitive home button takes a while to get use to. The device provides a haptic feedback through the phone's vibration system and has different intensity to suit your personal needs. After using this, the previous hardware home buttons already feel a bit clunky. The touch ID has improved and has better accuracy if it already didn't. **** IMPROVED CAMERA 2. Apple boasts about the dual camera set up on the larger variant but the smaller one does not fall way behind either. The f 1.7 aperture with OIS performs great under low light. The 4k video recording is also a great add-on. If you are a camera freak then you should definately go the larger variant. **** IMPROVED IPS LCD DISPLAY 3. Apple claims to have improved its color gamut on its display. The display is definitely better than the 6s but falls behind of the AMOLED technology. The viewing angles have also improved and the brightness also increased significantly. **** STEREO SPEAKERS 4. Apple ditched the old 3.5mm jack and instead placed a stereo speakers. The speakers are not bottom facing as one speaker is at the bottom while the earpiece at the top acts as the second one. This provides great immersive audio during gaming and entertainment. **** iOS 10 5. Apple's latest hardware is complemented by the latest in-house software. The new OS provides better gestures to interact with the device and provides additional productivity features. **** DESIGN 6. I personally prefer the matte black variant as the antenna lines perfectly blend in. The cellular reception falls slightly behind the 6s on this model. The Jet Black color looks gorgeous but is definitely a fingerprint magnet and gets scratched easily. **** BATTERY 7. During my review period, the battery lasted for a day easily. The stand by management of iOS is the best out there in the industry. VERDICT 1. With simple, robust and efficient operating system, this phone is definitely a must buy for users you want a simple yet intuative interface. 2. The stereo speakers combined with better display definitely allows for a better entertainment experience. 3. Water-resistance is a welcome feature as it can now easily withstand normal shower and rains. 4. It is a must upgrade from the iPhone 6 but if you are running a 6s then it is up to you if you want to trade in your audio jack for stereo speakers."
164308,mobile,Very nice product and fast delivery
151503,mobile,"Pos: This is best budget phone for non application user's. 1. Sound, camera and screen quality is good. Cons: more application installed on this budgeted phone is not good. Battery backup is not good. Battery will not stay one day,If we use phone heavy."

The picture quality is really good and the contrast ratio is also comparable with much higher prices tve. The panel quality is also very good with no light bleed. For those of you who are not able to get HDMI output in the HDMI ports please go to picture settings and set to enhanced 4k mode. The value proposition of this tv is really high compared to most competition

139592,smartTv,"It's been 7 months the TV was working fine, all of a sudden the display went partially black. On raising a request to MI service center, their technician visited and said that its a physical damage which is not covered under warranty, so I'll have to pay ‚Çπ 11,000 for the new panel (i bought this TV for 13k). I asked the technician to explain me how can a tv, which is in such a good condition (you can see I have not even removed the factory plastic) can get spoil. He said something might have fallen on the TV, I said if something has fallen, there must be some marks/ scratches etc. but he wasn't be able to explain. I called Amazon, they assured me that this issue would come under warranty, but nothing happened. MI service center started blaming me that I might have done something wrong. PS: Lost one loyal ""MI Fan"" pathetic service and product"

133144,smartTv,"Here's my first impression, will provide detailed review later on. 1) Wall charger is not included as part of the product, If you need a dedicated plug to charge this speaker, You need to shell out another 500Rs. for buying the plug separately. 2) ""Plug is not part the product"" info is conveniently left out of the specs and not mentioned about the charging 'Plug' not being part of the deal. I am definitely not amused with such shady sales approach."

135119,mobile,"I have been using Mi A2 for quite some time . Here's my review 1:- Price :- Good deal for the specs you get in this smartphone as compared to other smartphones. 2:- Camera Quality p:- It is just what you expect it to be ""Very Good"" indeed . The combination of 20+12 Mp camera is what you get top flagship phones and they are expensive. Coming to slow motion feature in it , is the good and Mi a2 does have 4k video recording. ( Note : - Some phones do not have hardware capabilities to record slow motion so they compensate it using software which records low quality video in high frame rate and the convert it into slow motion video of 360-420 pixels . """"BUT in Mi A2 it has hardware capability backed up by software resulting in a good 720 pixels slow motion video"""".) 3:-Processor:- Is an Octa core and a 2.5 GHz so you can expect decent processing power . For me I have tried couple of games and I was impressed by it's performance and even when you switch between games , it doesn't lag. (If it's heats up do not worry because processer is working very hard to keep up with your requirement and there are no vents from where heat can escape , so it's not a big problem) 4:-Battery life:- Mi A2 packs 3010 MAh battery , I will say its not impressive but enough to get you though the day. If you are a gamer it may not be enough for you. ( $$Bonus tip :- The charger they provide you is a standard charger but the Mi A2 support Turbo Charge and you may need to buy it separately for it $$) 5:- Display:- It is quite vivid and the colors are much real like ( not like over saturated colors) play.Overall Display score 5/5.. Speakers:- They have a decent output not that much loud. But is enough. Earpiece speaker is loud and very clear. ( If you enable volte (HD Call )option then you can hear some wired noises during call) Other Feature: 1:Android Pie is available for MI A2 2:Does have finger print sensor at back and is not that fast but enough. mi a2 does allow to secure apps with a finger print. 3: Dual Tone Flash and front led flash 4: Does retain a 3.5 mm jack Regards Lalit IronHide Technologies"

162657,mobile,Very disappointed with this Samsung M30S. Mainly purchase because of brand Samsung and 48 mexa pixel camera. But camera is very poor and the image look like as it is 5 mexa pixel. Samsung is doing fraud by misleading public by advertising it as 48 mexa pixel. Totally waste of money.

136877,refrigerator,"I think its the best camera for this price. Although I was uncertain whether to buy Canon 200d or Nikon d5600, now I really liked this Camera. Picture quality is superb, the 70-300 mm lens is really amazing. Although there is a little issue with the 18-55 mm lens regarding autofocus, I think that is not a big deal. The autofocus of the big lens is really good but the small lens sometimes doesn't work. Here is two sample photo which I've taken with this camera in raw format. I edited them a little bit with photoshop."

On the next day, the screen developed dark patches. Called apple care again and they said there's sone problem in the device and that I should try to get it replaced since it's from amazon which is not a authorized iPhone reseller. However amazon denied it since date for return had passed. So i then went to apple care again and after fighting with them for 3 hours, they finally agreed for a device replacement which arrived after 3 days. The phone has been tuning smooth since then however it was a horrible experience."
127387,smartTv,Good I'm very impressed with the performance
157950,mobile accessories,"The phone feels premium in hand. Excellent display. But the major drawback is battery life. I think quality control of Samsung is not functioning these days, otherwise how they allowed to launch a product with such a big issue. It claims this phone has 4000 mah battery, but it perform like a 2000 mah battery. Worst experience."

All day long battery... . Screen is great . Vivid. And show true colours . Dual sim plus memory card slot. . Gaming mode. Power mode. Night mode... Cons.. . Frankly i didnt find any cons in this . (Saying From a normal person perspective. ) Every thing is balanced in this phone. And i will say it is the best deal in this segment.. as it is only made for india. So its budget heavy ... And worth the money

166846,mobile,"Xiaomi Mi A2 is a powerful device with Snapdragon 660 coupled with 4 gigs of Ram , storage is 64 GB , usable approx 53 GB . Phone smoothly runs on stock Android. Main highlight of the phone is camera , 12 mpx rgb sensor with 5mp depth sensor . Selfie is 20mpx shooter. But I want to let you know that stock cameras performance is not good upto mark. So I prefer to use Gcam. As it's a stock Android device, bootloader unlocking is a work of minutes. Gcam working perfectly without root and camera improvement is drastic. I mean You won't consider Redmi Note 7 , or even 7 pro after seeing the results. After that battery manages to fuel up a day in medium usage. Gets Full charged in 1 hour and 30 minutes. UI is flat and ultra smooth. No bloatware . Still a better option in 11-12k segment if you want. Sleek device with metal body."

160382,mobile,This phone is really a good product for a multitasking person. The processor of this phone compares itself from any flagship processor. Camera quality is good compared to other phone in this price range. Also steady mode and super slow motion works well in camera. & battery life as well as told by company.
136599,mobile,"I purchased this phone for my dad hoping a hassle free experience. I got this phone delivered on 22nd. After powering on and basic configuration there after, phone prompted for upgrade to Android Pie. Which I did. First time upgrade failed and it happened successfully 2nd time. Then it prompted for security upgrade which I obliged. And then the phone got stuck after reboot. I can only see ""Andriod One"" screen anytime I press the power button and nothing else really happens. Software seems to be got corrupted. After 3 calls with Amazon and one visit by some technical person, Amazon agreed for a refund. Disappointed."

110443,mobile,"6gb 128gb version delivered on 29th. Costed 14,200/- after discounts and cashback. Good display and battery, holds nicely in hand. But battery heats up when using heavy apps. It also drains up in a day of moderate usage. Plastic body, average camera. Single speaker gives below average sound and mediocre performance. Not sure about durability. Just an average phone from Samsung. Amazon didn't accept my return request. Seems their policy have changed. So check return policy thoroughly when you buy electronic items any more. I'm ok this time as I need a second phone and I didn't pay a bomb."

153754,mobile,"Samsung is known for delivering some amazing displays and the Galaxy M30s tells the tale quite brightly. The phone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED Infinity-U display with a screen resolution of 2340 x 1080 pixels. The display offers own good colour reproduction and viewing angles are good as well. By default, the colours are muted, but you can switch to Vivid mode in the Display Setting to make it look punchier and colourful. The large screen makes the streaming experience a delightful one. We watched a couple of series on Galaxy M30s and we were satisfied with the display performance. The phone comes with Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos. Another area where the Galaxy M30s shines is the battery. The smartphone is equipped with a massive 6,000mAh battery and it comes with 15W fast charging support. The phone is currently the only one in this price segment that offers this much capacity. the phone easily lasted two days with an average screen time of 8 to 9 hours. When we stressed the battery performance by playing some games, streaming videos, using social media apps and for navigation, we still got almost one and a half-day of battery backup. The 15W fast charger was helpful for charging the phone within 1 hour and 30 minutes."

168672,mobile,iOS 13 is a failed attempt from apple. The phone doesn't have a smooth wifi or network connectivity. Its worse than some other phones half the cost. Absolute disappointment. Even older phones like 5s and 6s don't show network issues while the iPhone XR has these issues. Apple support is clueless and can't solve the issue. Disappointed with this apple product. All else is good just that the phones connectivity which is the most important thing for a phone is atrocious. Avoid if u can.

116308,mobile,"Been using for a few weeks, and loving the phone so far. Pros: 1) Excellent display - love the edgeless screen design. 2) Slim & comfortable to handle / type one-handed (I use a Swype keyboard). 3) Camera does very well in varying light conditions. Auto setting & smart shot guide will get you great pictures 9 of 10 times. Image quality isn't too bad even at high zoom. 4) BATTERY LIFE! Best I've ever seen. Phone still has 5-10% charge after full day (10-12 hours) of constant use, including having GPS, WiFi, hotspot, or Bluetooth on for long stretches, plus playing audio or videos, plus constant browsing & texts. Really lives up to the advertising here. (Also, the ""fast charging"" is really fast. 50% to 90%+ in an hour.) 5. Inbuilt ability to set up dual accounts (e.g. on WhatsApp) is great for a dual SIM phone. Had struggled to get this to work on earlier Android models. Totally smooth & easy here. Cons: 1. Sound quality is so-so. Not bad, but you're much better off pairing with a good set of headphones or a Bluetooth speaker for anything beyond basic calling. 2. Touchscreen sensitivity suffers if you're using a screen protector. There is a setting to enhance this, but still a bit slow at times. 3. No ""knock to unlock"" feature. Have to use the lock/power button each time. 4. With volume & power buttons on the same side, it's hard to take a screenshot one-handed. Overall 4.5 stars. Battery life makes it totally worth the price."

148670,smartTv,One if the big reasons to really purchase the phone was the camera quality. I had previously used iphone 6s and was quite impressed with the performance so switched to iphone 6s plus for a bigger screen. The phone feels great to hold because of the metal body

110528,books,A book that can change your view about rekationship goals.
110158,mobile,"1. Camera disappointed me alot. back camera 48 MP but in real it's 13 MP. Day light picture average but low light or in room it gives poor pictures quality. Front camera 16 MP but actually it's 8 MP. It is below average. Rest all feature are there like slow motion, super slow motion, image filter, blur effect, you can even change background of images after click picture means increase density of blurriness. 2. Second big disatvange charging. It take more than 3hrs to complete charge. If Samsung giving us 6000mah battery than fast charging must be there and 6000 mah is like 5000mah. 3. About Looks Back is made up of cheap plastic I have saw many YouTube videos there it looks shiny and glossy but in real it is simple plastic panel not feel it's premium and easy get scratched .so back cover is compulsory. 4. From front side it looks premium. phone display is awesome. But no gorilla glass protection so you must buy good quality screengaurd. 5. Fingerprint, face lock, sound quality, radio, calling experience, network, performance all are good like Samsung phones. No earphones, tempred glass and back case in box. You have to buy it yourself. At last you can buy this phone if you are not selfy lover. You can say its average phone and Samsung ka barosa."
162021,smartTv,Value for money good features easily connects to my iPhone finally good product
111045,mobile accessories,About phone- This mobile is very nice to see because its U shape 6:4 inch super amoled display Display- the display of m30 is super .darkness and dynamic colour range is really good. I hope this display is best compare to another phones Battery- the battery of m30's is really huge Samsung provide 5000 MAh huge capacity battery but notice that the battery's real capacity is 4900MAh. Processor-this phone run xyenos 7904. This processor is not best but better for multitasking and medium quality games . Fingerprint and face unlock- fingerprint lock and face unlock is a little bit of slow but finger print now a little bit of fast after 1st may's software update Camera-the camera is really good but night mode options not used in this phone .

Can be charged using original charger supplied along with phone only If we use other charges it takes hours and hours to charge. Headphones not included. Body is prone to easy scratches. In camera location not getting saved. Auto updates not getting installed. Seems some issue with inside GPS chip. After discount and cash back, received it an effective price of 11700. Worth each penny. Kudos to Amazon Delivery. On time as assured."

118461,smartTv,"Bought this in the shopping festival sale. Since we were buying a tv after a long time, we went for the 55"", though the 49"" version was a better deal (53k). But this was also quite a good deal (for 70k) compared to anything else in stores. 55"" seems quite big initially but after setting it in the room and using it, it seems to be big enough but not too big. The picture quality is excellent. We were upgrading from 30"" so more than happy with the larger screen and the newer display technologies. 4K content is still hard to come by but we checked some 4K videos on youtube and they were very good. Eagerly awaiting some high quality 4K movies on Prime and Netflix so we can give it the full spin. The sound is also quite good but we had some random volume change concerns. Its only been 2 days so will check it again and update if it persists. So far, we don't feel the need to add a home theatre system with this. We are primarily using the tv for online content so haven't checked it with any of the cable networks. Installation was pretty straightforward. Haven't yet installed the wall mount. Will do it over the coming few days."

147840,refrigerator,"Note:- Canon camera body does not have in body image stabilization, canon provides image stabilization through lens and camera body depends on lenses for image stabilization, if lens does not support image stabilization camera will not be able to stabilize. Canon 200d is one of the smallest dslr out there this improves upon its older variant 100d. It packs serious upgrades, first sensor is change and is now have dual pixel sensor, similar auto focus mechanism has been changed, internal processor is now digic7, video recording capacity has been upgraded too. Pros:- 1080/60p video capture Microphone input jack for external microphone for better audio recording 24MP sensor with Dual Pixel AF right now only canon is offering this. Good image quality considering this sensor is used in almost all higher end apc camera. 3"" fully-articulating touchscreen LCD Dual pixel Phase-detect Auto Focus System 5 fps continuous shooting Digic 7 processor Accurate Auto Focus in both photo and video Responsive touchscreen and interface Very good video and image stabilization Wi-Fi,Bluetooth,NFC that can be used for image transfer and as remote control. Light weight. Decent battery life. Easy to use, easy to use auto mode. Easy to use interface. Made for starter, casual shooter and beginners. Cons 9-point center cross auto focus system which is old considering price and other canon line ups Plastic build quality of body Lags behind in dynamic range No 4K video recording Bundled lens kit is just average. Suggestion:- Try local markets, you might be able to get the product for cheaper price. Get a prime lense preferably 35mm or 50mm for best image and videos. Verdict:- Canon 200 is serious entry level dslr which quitely sits below 800d. It is decent upgrade from 750d, 100d and offers great features and functionality. It offers the all the functionality of 800d at praction of its price. The real shortcoming is that it does not support 4k video, other wise it would have been a perfect DSLR. Nonetheless if is good and a recommended camera. I hope my review has been helpful to you. If you have any question feel free to message me or comment down below. I shall be glad to assist you"
115920,mobile accessories,Battery life is not up to the mark and phone is heating up while charging.
124294,mobile accessories,"Flagships! They're high end premium devices that come out once a year (commonly) which pack pretty much every high tech feature imaginable. They represent a company's idea of what a powerful phone should be. But like a lever other phone, even they get 'old'. And I'm guessing we all use our premium phones for at least 2 years. In that case, how a phone ages overtime also plays a crucial role in determining it's power and value. So taking a second look at them after several years of release is a worthwhile thing to do. Let's do just that. How about we take a second look at Apple's ex- flagship model, the iPhone 6s. How has it aged since September 2015? Is it still worth buying in 2017? Let's find out. So, the iPhone 6s has seen some price drops recently. The base model has been bumped up to 32 GB, which if not impressive, is still better than the worthless 16 gig model we had earlier. You all know how that phone was perceived by the public back in 2015. After all the excitement died down, these are the things that have (kinda) held up after approximately 2 years of usage: The build: The phone is made our of 7000 series aluminium and has managed to survive a few minor drops over the period of its moderate usage. It will last a pretty long time, if you are somewhat careful with your handling. The display: Yes, I know. It's not even 1080p. But the lack of pixels isn't as evident unless you compare it side by side with a full HD panel. On its own, it's still pretty good, though you can't play 1080p videos on your 'premium' phone. But it has that excellent brightness output of (close to) 600 nits, so there's that! The front camera(somewhat..): The front camera remains pretty good, even among the present gen smartphones which are all set out to be 'selfie experts'! You'll have good quality selfies and videos upto 720p from this front snapper. Although you get higher quality videos from other phones, you can't deny the accurate colors that this phone captures. The software: Well, I'm talking about the software support. It still has the latest and greatest OS updates from Apple and won't be discontinued any time soon. That's not to say it's flawless though. I've experienced several lags and slow downs and crashes throughout the UI, from iOS 9 till 10.3 to date. More on that later. These were some of the things that still remain significant despite to the cut-throat competition. Now let's look at the things that aren't doing too well after aging: The general performance: Now let me be clear, the 6s is not a laggy mess by any means. To a lot of people, it's still a pretty fast and fluid phone. But it does slow down quite a lot. I've seen a lot of phones and I can clearly see some dropped frames in the UI/ animations and delays while opening apps such as camera or facebook. In other words, even the iPhone is affected by age and can slow down to a crawl overtime. The 64 gb model I've seen has managed to stay decently responsive, but hasn't aged as smooth as something like the Nexus 6P. That phone is still one of the smoothest out there! Battery life: You probably saw this one coming. The small 1810 mAh on the 6s barely lasts a day of usage, and has gotten worse overtime. Having too many apps on board along with mixed 4G/ wifi usage drains this tiny cell pretty quickly. You won't make it through a day, if you're constantly using wireless services. Recharge speed also sucks. The puny charger included can barely pump put 1 amp of current and takes about an hour and a half to completely charge this thing. It's unacceptable at least in my view, because it's dumb. Such a small battery unit shouldn't take so damn long to charge up. The Hardware: Yeah, things aren't too bright over here either. I'm taking about the sensors and stuff. After 2 years of usage, the fingerprint sensor known as TouchID has stopped reliably working. It fails to recognise my fingerprint 6/10 times. ‚ÄãThat's sad, considering it was one of the finest when it was launched. It was positively criticized of being 'way too fast' at the time. Now its 'way too frustrating'. The finger as well as the home button needs to be cleaned nicely before I can place my thumb on it. But when it does work, it's still pretty fast at unlocking. Other things like the genealogy specs aren't too great for 2017 either. Though 2 GB of RAM is good enough for iOS, it's not the king of multitasking any more. The DDR3 unit can barely keep some heavy duty apps and games open in the background. You'll see a lot more app and launcher reloads with modern day apps, and this will only get slower overtime. The rear camera: Though the front sensor remains pretty competent, the rear camera sadly isn't. The 12 mp sensor with a tiny aperture is easily bested by even mid range phones of the present day. It's good enough outdoors bit produces pretty grainy and blurry images indoors and at night. Not super happy about that. Okay, this was the breakdown about what's good and what's not good about the iPhone 6s, today. So should you buy this price dropped phone now? If you're a strictly casual user who sticks to basic apps, doesn't mind about the rather poor battery life but wants above average performance, I'd say go for it. You'll probably be okay with the 32 gb storage too. But if you are anywhere near a 'moderate/heavy user zone', you know what to do already. Look elsewhere! There are much, much better phones that this one for hardcore road warriors among you, which will not only serve you well overtime, but will also pack modern hardware."
131533,mobile,Got this product in the amazon flash sale and got a decent discount. Have been using the device for a few days and can certainly say that this iPhone has the best battery life till date. Phone lasted for almost 30 hours with heavy usage. The face recognition has certainly been improved from iPhone X. The only thing I dislike about the phone is the Screen Quality. You won‚Äôt find any major difference in the screen quality unless and until you stream Netflix or watch YouTube. Overall I feel this is one of the best iPhones apple has launched.

134064,mobile accessories,I am written this review after 18 days of use. I have purchased 6 GB RAM white colour Mobile is getting heat the heat temperature is so high that you need to switch off your mobile. Camera quality se good even battery is also working fine. About performance it looks like we are using 3 GB RAM system is acquiring near about 3.4 GB of RAM so you will be getting only 2.6 GB RAM for use. PUBG GAME is also not working not value for money. If we are listening to song at that time mobile is also getting heat. Never expect this from SAMSUNG Please don't bye it I have

147709,mobile accessories,Not up to the mark
136607,mobile,"I purchased this phone on 29th September and thus this is a review after using it for about 10 days. Pros- 1. Camera-Macro mode is love! 2. Display- Fluidic display which everyone will love 3. Processor and RAM- These make the phone superfast 4. Service- I received a defective product which the service center replaced in just one day! Overall happy with the service, they were prompt and responsive. 5. Charging- Warp charge 30T is the best! Charges 3800mah battery in less than an hour. 6. Stereo speakers- loud and crisp 7. Notch is little bit smaller than OnePlus 7 Cons- 1. Battery- Not upto expectations, earlier I owned OP5 which had 3300 mah battery which later more than a day on average usage. But this phone just clears 24 hrs on moderate usage and if we play games like pubg, it just can't reach 24 hrs. Though I get about 5-6 hrs screen on time which is good. 2. No 3.5mm jack- It can be a con for this device but I assure you that listening from type-c is much better than the jack, try to experience it yourself. Overall, if you want a phone like OP7pro/7Tpro at less price and can give up curved display, I think this can be the best choice. Just go for it."

After so watching so many comparisons I finally decided to go with view 20.. The only con is that it has a little bit of screen bleeding issue... But trust me that doesn't effects.... Pubg at its best.. Camera is beast... With whooping 48mp shooter.. Many complain about camera because by default it shoots with 12mp shooter... I m not a good photo graphed. But will surely share my shots....charging speed is very nice with the supercharged 40w tech.... Overall u will definitely love it.. And it is definitely better than op6t until UI is the thing for uto concern about.... Night mode is really fabulous..

Battery life/charging duration : Interestingly, being 6K MAH capacity, it takes minimum of 4 hours to charge even with fast charge option & also it drains out in 12 hours of usage 3. Screen experience is not up-to the mark, does not work smoothly 4. It heats up like a burning coal even with a 45 minute usage of web based/internet based applications 5. From plays store most of the times it gets stuck to download any application (even most commonly used applications such as BMS, Cricbuzz,Paytm,etc) Nothing more to say..it's up to you to go for it or not.."

Battery is really a monster one. Good camera quality. Previously I was using one plus 3t. There r few features lacking in this phone like themes option isn't good enough, double tap wake up isn't here, it has plastic body, etc. But when it comes to battery backup, this is the monster. It has a fast fingerprint option but you've swipe its screen everytime even after face unlocking. Speaker volume is good with extra loud levels. Rest I'll update here after using this device."

Even that continuity of design is a break from convention; after almost a decade of Apple‚Äôs steady two-year iPhone update pattern, merely retaining the same design for a third straight year plays against expectations. Inside that case, everything else about the iPhone 7 is a decisive statement about the future. The dual cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus promise to usher in a new era in mobile photography. The iconic iPhone home button is no longer a physical button, but instead a sophisticated ballet of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that simulate the feel of a button. The new A10 Fusion processor blends two high-power cores that rival laptop performance with two low-power cores that combine with a much larger battery to extend run time by up to two hours. And, yes, Apple has removed the headphone jack."

165248,smartTv,"Well, it's not as easy as that. The iPhone 7 is in many ways a better phone. We can see some of the issues we had with the last iPhone sorted and, no, we are not claiming credit for it - simply acknowledging the fact. Waterproofing, stereo speakers and, finally, reasonable storage options - and that's on top of the usual performance upgrades we've come to take for granted every year. Think this is the story of the iPhone 7? Apple's first water-resistant handset, first quad-core processor, first pair of stereo speakers on a phone. Not trying to build suspense. The story has been hijacked and you know it. But we're going to tell it anyway.

Although I set my ringer alert to 'Ring' and the ring volume high, within a few seconds the ring volume goes down and the pop-up is seen on screen often. All the calls and notifications is notified only by vibration and not by sound. Not happy with the product. Did everything as assisted by the one plus team. No use. Initiated return"
128625,mobile accessories,Good mobile.
167834,smartTv,first of all let me say. if you have Alexa echo dot than don't go for this speaker worse sound than Alexa echo dot. plus not compatible with Alexa devices. Its a small speaker just enough for your study table or close to bed. Like a mini speaker sought of thing. Plus worse is they say its eligible for return but u can't return it. so they play you for a fool. I wanted to return this and go for a better louder Sony speaker but they are not taking my return even when I am not satisfied with sound quality. So lets say spend 4000 more and go for Sony's advance bluetooth speakers.

The picture, sound and features are very good still more to explore the product. But only unsatisfactory about the product is only one USB and 2 HDMI which is very less of the amount paid. (3 HDMI and 2 USB should have been a worth for this price)"

Cons: The 3 gb ram phone is dead slow when we toggle between apps Gaming experience is terrible, the screen freezes most of the time The fingerprint unlock takes quiet some time to unlock the phone Camera clarity is of very bad quality Watching movie for 3 hours will drain the battery completely. The phone can be of good review with the senior citizens, as they will not bug/use the phone much."

161570,refrigerator,Using it for more than a week and loving it. Very easy to setup. Lots of Watch faces available for free. The dial makes it easy to navigate and rotate. Water proof. Weight is moderate. Size fits better with bigger hands. Looks good on both Gender. Much better than any Fitbit products where you face regular sync issues and is supported by service centers unlike Fitbit where you've to throw the watch away if there's any problem after 1 year. Battery Life - 3 days with moderate to high use Charging - Takes 2-3 hours to fully charge Pairing - Takes seconds to pair with Galaxy Phones with the app. Not sure about other Android phones. Call Quality - Good enough speaker and Mic. Very useful while driving. Screen - Good enough for outdoor App Requirement - Galaxy Gear
139260,mobile,It's a good mobile phone. All are good apart from battery which also seems ok. Change the Home launcher with other Xiaomi developed home launcher via downloading from Google play and install. Your phone will never hang or slow. It will also changed the theme which is more user friendly as default one.
157733,refrigerator,"The main feature apart from other excellent ones ,is its look. Its solid built and has a strong Masculine Look.Compared to any other ( yes..Apple no class ..)Smart watch in the market the look of this makes it unique. The changeable Watch face is interesting. You can change according to the place or a function you visit. ( like sports or a formal function) .All the other functions are working good.The Bazel rotation is Samsung's Monopoly....and USP...no other smart watch in the market has this..( i think..not sure ) ...Being a fitness freak ..i am gonna explore more of its Health features...Bought it on Prime Day sell and got a great deal Rs. 16K...so all the Fitness Freak boys go for it..."

152934,books,Really good book. Covers a lot of aspects. However it does need revision.
159692,smartTv,"This is detailed comparison between iPhone 8, X, XS & XR, after using each of them for a month. @ I am also stating the detailed battery performance of each phone. This is a long review, but its worth if you willing to spend your hard earned money. BUILT QUALITY : -------------------- # iphone 8 and XR have glass front and back, ringed with metal frames (aluminum), which looks more premium and worth the price you pay. But also are susceptible to easy damages. # iphone X and XS are made of stainless steel, which don't appears that luxurious comparatively, but are more sturdier and less prone to damage compared to 8 and XR. # Among all iphone 8 is lightest and XR heaviest, with X and XS being almost similarly weighed. # To me in this parameter, iphone 8 seems the better choice. DISPLAY : ----------- # iphone 8 has smallest display(4.7"") and XR the biggest(6.1""), with X and XS with same size(5.8""), so is the screen to body ratio. # Display resolution of X and XS is same and the best amongst all, while 8 and XR is same and lowest ( NOT even FHD ). Similarly, X & XS have OLED, while 8 & XR have LCD :P # According to my usage I found X & XS to be much better value for money in terms of display quality. SYSTEM PERFORMANCE : ----------------------------- # I noticed XS performing slightly better than XR, though both of them have same processor. Followed by X and 8. # If you are normal user like me then you wont mind using iphone 8 over XS, as 8 can do everything that XS can easily. # I found X to be better value for money in this segment. BATTERY PERFORMANCE : ------------------------------ # All 4 phones are equipped with fast charging, wireless charging. # XR use to last over 20 hours with normal multitasking, with 4G ON continuously all the time. *XS use to last between 16-18 hours, X did 14-15 hours and 8 use to lasts upto 12 hours. # With Heavy multitasking, XR lasted over 11 hours, XS did over 9 hours, X lasted over 8 hours and 8 lasted upto 6 hours. # Certainly XR outshines others in battery performance. CAMERA : ----------- # In this segment, I noticed iphone X to be the best among all when using Rear camera. * Colours are more punchy and true to real. Night time photography is also excellent. # XS sometimes does better over X, but not always. # Front camera of X, XS and XR are same and performs almost similarly. # Each one supports 4K, OIS, slow motion. PRICE (64GB) : --------------- 8 - Rs.55K X - Rs.75K XR - Rs.77k XS - Rs.99K # Here certainly 8 is winner :P P.S: you get a physical home button on iphone 8, which certainly comes handy. VERDICT : ----------- After using each phone, I can conclude that if you are tight on budget then going for iphone 8 is best choice. If you have 80k to spare, then certainly go for iphone X. And if budget is not in your dictionary, then certainly go for iphone XS. To me iphone XR is not worth the price at all, except the battery performance, it doesn't have any noticeable parameter. If you already own a iphone 7, then don't upgrade unless, you have money to waste. If you have 6s or below, then only go for upgrade. Hope this review helps."

Seriously camera is great and low light mode and exposure is great. Battery will last for only 1 day for a mid-high usage. No heating issue even while on first charging. Out of 64GB ROM I got 52 GB user usable. Main cons are no SD card slot and battery capacity is not too high for more than 1 day usage. Pros are seriously superb camera quality in this tight budget range, call and cellular quality is too good, stock UI and android one is performing well, display color quality is also nice and vivid."

110096,mobile,"....after roughly 4 months of use, i could only my phone with the powerbank after handholding the chord in the powephonerbank port with some pressure. since it was under warranty, i took it to the mi service centre in dwarka, delhi only to be told that they wouldnt repair it as powerbanks cannot be repaired, and they would not replace it either as the powerbank had dents, which they couldnt point out where. only kept on harping that it was dented. i told them that wear and tear was bound to happen in any product that was regularly used, but this powerbank was certainly not dented, broken or shattered. on insistence that they give me in writing that they wouldnt replace it, they handed me a sheet which had some unfamiliar technical term mentioned on it. on enquiring what it meant, they said it meant the product was out of warranty and i could report them anywhere i wanted. i certanly found this service centre in dwarka, sector 7, delhi to be a scam. and i fear wrong action from them as they now have both my address and phone number (mentioned on amazons invoice; which i had to hand over to them as proof of purchase)."

The fingerprint reader is quick as rocket.The camera truly delivers to its promise and the extra features of slow motion video and super stability is icing on the cake.The pictures comes bright and crisp of both front and rear camera.The processor does its work pretty well be its gaming,net surfing,media playing without any lag.The decision to buy this mobile is one of the best decision I have taken in recent days.Thanks Samsung India for bringing this handset for all masses in budget along with all features. 10/10 by me."

110645,mobile accessories,"A good phone. Very good battery. With heavy usage, it goes from 100% to 10% in about 26-30 hrs. Camera is more or less good. Not good in night time. Fast charging takes about 2 hrs 15 mins from 10% to 100%. Fingerprint sensor is quite good, takes about 0.5 seconds to read."

169889,mobile accessories,some times its get hanged. if use multiple application.
118577,mobile,"Brought this mobile for my mom. Manily purchased it keeping budget in mind and my mom's a ability to handle a smart phone. Not regreting too much since the user is amateur. But, if you are an advanced user or a gamer kindly avoid this phone. There are few more options available if you can able to add few more thousands to your budget. Build quality is okay Display is okay, not that great. Keep in mind that you can only watch 720p YouTube videos only. Camera quality is not that great. Remember, it has got only 2GB ram, when running on Oreio and Pie 3GB is mandatory. So, you can notice moderate lag. Battery life is not up to the mark. It's only 3000mah battery. Can stand for one day if used moderately. Takes lot of time to get fully charged. The charger capacity is only 5volt and 1amps. Speaker volume is low and when you are on call it's moderately loud. Signal quality is good. If you are really tight on budget, please accumulate few more bucks and go for other options in the same price range other than this. This is purely ment for amateurs. Don't expect to play PUBG at full graphics with this phone."

132420,mobile,"Great product..high speed and convenient to use...and cannot get damaged easily from heat,water and dust"
159567,mobile,"This is a sell In the name of brand image what both amazon and Samsung has established. It seems like product has not gone through quality tests and lunched hastily due to festive season. My honest opinion: Pros: 1.Good Battery(Camera consume battery very fast) for moderate use 2.Few UI feature given to keep Apps away from running in background(I felt it better than Google Android-one UI on this specific aspect). It may help in preventing wastage of charge. 3.Always on display and few gesture controls make it user friendly. 4.Has good Screen brightness,can be readable at outdoor condition. Cons: 1.Camera is a gimmick,It will shoot good pics if shots are taken within approx 5 meter radius,object shot is large,objects well exposed to light and camera is kept as much as along direction of light source .Colors do not seem natural, pics contain too much noise and ,very bad edge detection.I have attached 15 MB pic shot 48 MP camera on this phone and 5 Mb shot pic shot by a 12 MP camera of Mi A1.Viewers can distinguish the quality themselves.The one shot in Mi was shot against light source,still it detects good edges and color seems to be natural.With 100% zoom you can still identify the object and edges.The one shot in M30S although shot along source of light, the edges see much distortion by just zooming it 10%. With more zoom you can not identify what the object was. Videos shot even with 4k contains good amount of noise.Colors seem to be super saturated both in pics and videos,pics shot are much darker than natural.Night mode photography contains immense amount of noise.It only magnifies the brightness wherever color is detected,it distorts the edges badly and you will find noises like dust storm. One weird feature I observed is that when you try to shoot pic, the handset makes the pic seem 4 times more distant than actual contrary to the pic what it promotes for hot air balloon or the ladakh pic on Amazon site. 2.Audio is not up-to the mark.With Dolby Atmos, UHS and equalizer on, it seems voice loses around 20% clarity.It is not loud either.Voice output is not loud even in headphone and the lows and highs are less clear even with good standard headphone.It seems voice is always supressed under instrument or sorrounding sounds. 3.Screen Width to length ratio is such that many videos do not fit to screen.Even if Zoom option is available, making the video full screen makes it lose contents around edge 4.Videos played on streaming app on phone clearly seems to loose color reproduction.Videos loose sharpness exponentially with increase in movement or motion within videos.It seems to be issue with the processor.Even video casted to TV see this effect and video played from within internet tv has better color reproduction. 5.Adapter takes more than 3.5 hours to fully charge the phone while it is on and around 2.5 hours if it is switched off. 6.Out of given 4 GB RAM,512 MB reserved for unknown purpose, Apps take 1.8 GB even if all put to sleep, hence around 1.5 GB of RAM available for use. 7.Poly carbonate case does not feel sturdy and it seems there is some gap between case and core phone around sim ejector.It seems prone to water seepage even in light drizzle. 8.Due to lesser screen width it will take more of your effort for typing accurately in portrait mode,the reason being keyboard key of less width.In landscape mode keyboard fills 75% of screen,it leaves you to type without watching the content output on screen.I noticed some word suggestion not of English type while typing in English.Ex: It was suggesting knoledge for Knowledge. 9.There are security risks I observed, I noticed many new apps in my app screen although I never set permission to any app to install other third party apps.I personally do not feel safe for banking activities. I have noticed all these flaws even if I was using basic handset like Mi A1 for last two years.Except for battery, Mi A1 handset was superior then this M30S.Any person who is not biased for a particular brand handset can clearly identify the quality. I would be very happy to return this handset and get my Old Mi A1 back if Amazon could allow so. I could not understand why it tags itself ""Made for India"". This phrase seems to be a misnomer,Indians have evolved and have good eye to distinguish compromised and good quality product.Will never rely anymore on promotion done by Amazon and Samsung and paid reviewers who never tell actual issues in a product."
165542,mobile,Wire is awesome and helps adapter to increase the charging speed.
117736,mobile,"Best product by Mi, Sharp service by seller and Amazon. Keep it up."

148800,mobile accessories,One of the best low budget ranged earphones. Bought it for ‚Çπ999 . Sound quality is good wand has a very good noise cancellation. The audio sounds good with a good bass. Typically works fine for 5-6 hours.
160996,mobile,Too much bad... It work properly only 15-20 days and after that the battery drains so fast with in 1 hours.... Tooo much bad.... Please don't buy it......
122690,mobile accessories,"Excellent phone, batty is lower compared to other phones of this ranges"
138930,smartTv,It must be supportive with external hard disk.
156989,mobile accessories,The Xiaomi MI A3 is a wonderful device in this price point Cons: The only cons that I can find is the screen being only hd and the absence of an 18W fast charging brick (and the hybrid tray) but considering that I got this for Rs.10700 due to the sale its an absolute killer Pros: As for the pros almost everything about this device comes in this category 1) Stock Android: just love the clean bloatware free experience on this device sure lacks some useful functions but still stock is stock 2) Camera: you get 2 snappers on the rear the 3rd is for depth sensing normal pictures get a default 12mp or 9mp depending on the object in the picture the dedicated 48mp mode is nice.The wide angle pics have softening around the edges and really struggle at night time but the 48mp works fine. The front snapper is a whole different story though it clicks at 32.3mp and the pictures show great colors even without a depth sensor it creates great bokeh effects for ur selfies. 3) Battery: this thing comes with a 4030mah battery which supports 18W fast charge and if u have a 18w brick u can get full juice in around 45 mins 4) OLED: this is the thing the hd screen is bearable u get pitch black blacks on this device 5) Fingerprint sensor: although not the fastest it still is pretty good one however I prefer using the face unlock instead 6) Processor: being a snapdragon 665 the processor does great multitasking and even handles slight gaming perfectly however this phone isn't for gaming
141137,smartTv,Just awesome laptop for editing videos.
148086,mobile,"OMG üòç can't believe that xiaomi has launched a powerpacked budget device.I bought the 6gb ram version and its as fast as Cheetah.Played pubg mobile in HD with no lag.Fortnite will be supported in future.Picture quality is just amazing,,even sound quality is good,really loud.Battery life is ok,will last a day with continuous usage.Great work Amazon.Overall very good product."

131997,mobile,"Great mobile, but it DOESN'T have FM Radio. The specifiactions on Amazon says it has, hence I bought it, but returned as it did not. Long story short it was heck of a bad experience returning it. But we really liked the mobile otherwise, as we were looking for a good camera mobile, but with FM. If the brand managers read, please understand FM is a required feature in Bharat, i am not sure what it costs to mobile manufacturers, but rest assure, many in Bharat dont buy a high end mobile as it lacks this feature. for example me!"

118324,mobile accessories,"Bought a Redmi Note 3 on sep'2016. Used to update MIUI whenever there is an update. After the latest update to MIUI to 9.5.6 last week, the wifi detection function stopped working. The service centers had no clue. they reset my phone completely deleting my personal setup. That did not solve the problem. They came back and said that the phone needs a Mainboard Assy change and gave me a quotation for 4482.82. I stepped back and decided to look for another phone and that would certainly not an Xiaomi or Redmi. Google search also will tell you that this issue is commonly reported by Redmi users. There is a problem record in the MIUI support portal with no definite solution."
134362,mobile,"I bought this phone in Oct 2018. It was less than 6 months and the phone started hanging & making random noises. I have taken it to service centre thrice since then and they have failed to repair it every time. Each time I go, they just factory reset and give it back, however, the problem still persists. On asking them to replace it since the phone is under warranty, they ask to contact customer care who in turn asks us to visit service center. It has been 4 months since the problem and I don't find any resolution to it. Would strongly suggest anyone buying Mi phones to refrain from buying it. Their phones are bogus, so is their service & so are their warranties."

124955,mobile,"Go monster! As the name says, its battery life is just amazing. With a medium heavy usage it lasted me 48 hours on a single charge from 100% to 15%. Its camera is 48 megapixel primary, so the quality is great even when you fully zoom into the photo! The build looks solid, simple design, and a stunning sAMOLED display is sure to immerse you into the experience!"
167588,mobile accessories,camera quality
168332,mobile,"good screen, surprisingly easy to hold, brilliant battery backup, good camera but expect more from the 48mp triple unit. Samsung OneUI is easy to use. have some concerns on the network and data performance. network bars are lower on this device compared to others running the same provider. data sometimes disconnects and needs a network reset to come back. hope it gets fixed in the next update."
153775,mobile accessories,"Samsung needs to workout to get their phones hang issue. I am writing this review within one hour after receiving my phone. Phone started once but hang out later before completing android setup. Somehow, I managed to factory reset but again phone is not getting on but stucked at STARTING ANDROID and not gettung off.. Now it's almost 2 hours & phone is showing same status. I contacted Amazon Customer Service, who setup a techinical engineer to check the phone & then they will decide if phone is faulty or not.."
113501,mobile,"Awe of the redmi 6a with high quality, awsome camera, face recognition and light weight.. love it"
130734,smartTv,"Good quality and and neat customer support. Picture quality is good and other Android features like play store, apps,, Chromecast works. Netflix works. Amazon Prime can be sideloaded and works. DTS and Dolby digital audio through coax to avr. ES file explorer can be installed and shared drive on PC can be mapped to play HDR movies from pC using built in player or others like MX player. Comes with VLC but VLC plays DTS as Dolby so use internal player or MX player. Internal storage is low so uninstall crappy apps that u won't be using.can sideload chrome, Jio tv.supports 5ghz wifi band also.really well thought out and implemented product.It does support Amazon prime.I have been using prime for 4 months Get the app using Racoon and sideload it.This tv uses the capabilities of Android to the fullest extent.If you love technology and tinkering around to get best out of Android features without spending too much money then this is the one.It gives out DTS with all possible DTS decoder on your avr to work with.atleast my onkyo has 4different dts decoder, thx and the audio through spdif coax works. Cast your entire mobile screen using Google home app as this tv has in-built Chromecast. Jio tv,Airtel tv apps when sideloaded will work. 5G dand Wifi."
152321,mobile,Pros : - Battery (min 2days) - Display - light weight - quick charge Cons : - some of the google apps not supported - Apps are not sorted in order (can be done via other app launchers)

143537,mobile,My review of my new empowered M30s by samsung : Pros : 1. Camera : samsung has up their game by introducing such an excellent camera in this price range. 2. Battery : It is truly the best thing about the new M30s. Truly deserved to be India's 1st phone with 6000 mAh battery. 3. Design : New colors are excellent. I am in love with my sapphire blue M30s Almost packed up with all features with 6gb ram and 128gb memory. This phone is best in this price range and yes it gives you a brand value which you look for. I am in awe of this and would recommend this phone to everybody. PS: Attaching few pics from M30s of my recent kerala trip.

131451,mobile,"Got the brand new MI A1 fee hours back as an exchange offer with my old Xiaomi Redmi 4. Had a cracking deal and got this beauty at only 5995/- INR. The phone is a stunning beauty and gives an amazing first impression, the moment you take it out of the box. I'll have to use it for a few days to comment about it features but meanwhile what I found amazing is the stock Android performance, you get the phone with Android Oreo and within few minutes you get the Pie update and several security updates. Camera of the phone is just brilliant, absolutely stunning. And the speakers are quite loud and clear. If you're getting it at a good deal, then just go for it. It's a classy phone and worth the money spent on it. Exchanging phone was really hassle free, Amazon courier guys did a really fast and great job. And overall loved the experience of phone exchange over Amazon."
152486,mobile accessories,Pros:- 1.GOOD BATTERY LIFE. 2.AMAZING DISPLAY. 3.SUPERB IMAGES WITH VIBREANT EXPOSURES. cons:- 1.sometimes it heats up while playing high graphic games. 2.electronic image stabalization is not present. 3.Selfie camera is not that good Conclusion:- In this price segment the phone has its best performance.we could not expect more than this in 11k or 13K both the devices are good. You van surely go for it if image stabalization is not the part of your everday use. üëç to samsung for this amazing device.

160003,mobile,"This is the first ever review I'm writing because I could not resist sharing my opinion after a months use of my MI A2 (6GB, 128 GB) smart phone. It is extremely good phone, very competitive pricing and good service. Amazon services are also too good. This phone is working very well and to the expectation. Camera quality is good, display is at par with the competitors. Battery could have been little better, but I'm not using it for gaming, it's okay for my use. Finger print sensor is very responsive.. Great product by MI, amazing service by Amazon"
133753,mobile accessories,"I am not able to connect my wifi with the phone, went through all the threads and everything but nothing helps. What a waste."
119516,mobile,Camera quality worst Batter life is less than a day Phone over weight Touch is not good Also hang sometimes
120097,mobile,"Cost is high. They have modified redmi note 6 pro's camera shape and selling it in the name of Mi A2 and battery is worst. Camera alone is good. MI A2 is just worth for Rs.12k range . Moto One power and Redmi Note 6 pro are better. Even Huawei competitors are better. I bought it for Rs.16k on Jan 03,2019 and today Xiaomi is announcing its original price at Rs.14k . #MI - THE WORST CHINESE BRAND#"

134118,mobile accessories,I bought Samsung m10s last week on November 1 the product was amazing the performance is excellent and main highlight of the phone is display and battery life. It comes with 15watts charger out of the box and charges within 1.45 hours and I am getting 1.5 days battery with 9 hrs to 10hrs of screen on time with pubg playing of 2hrs and super amoled display is very bright and blacks are very deep and fingerprint reader is very accurate and fast so at last good choice under 8k Excellent buys thanks Samsung for this phone

150269,smartTv,"Performance is really disappointing, even if you are browsing the internet. Multitasking is not possible with 4GB RAM. For better performance, need to upgrade the RAM. I am using this laptop last 6 months, but after upgrading the RAM [12 GB], the performance is so good. Pros: After upgrading the RAM, performance is good. Cons: Slow performance [Force to upgrade the RAM] This laptop is best for study, writing and entertainment purpose only. Not for programmer. Best for student, Learner."

Even though there is a variance of 12¬∞C Amazon, Tech executive are saying it is working fine. Ears are burning while taking. Amazon is not helping to return the phone. Xiaomi is looting money with very cheap quality phones. People should avoid these kind of phones. A big NO."

133254,mobile,"Hi guys, I bought M30s on 29th sept'19. This phone is value for money, its processor, face detection and fingerprint is very fast. Battery is monster, in a single charge it gives you battery backup upto 3 days. Display is awesome. I am very satisfied after getting this phone. Firstly, I was thinking to buy S8 but when I compare the specs of M30s I was shocked as M30s has Exynos 9611 and S8 has Exynos 8895 and there is no comparision between battery. When I was getting lots of specification with reputated brands in 11599, how could I bought other phone. I will suggest M30s over all phones in this range. It is really a monster."

124160,smartTv,"First of all i would like to thanks amazon for their fast delivery, they delivered My iPhone within 24 hours... And as i used My iPhone 7 32 GB phone only few days so, i can't describe more but till now every thing is awesome i found in comparison to android phones, since i was using android phone from last 6 years. My views: 1. 2GB RAM is more then sufficient because iPhone manufacturers and developers has done good job to maintain background processes. 2. Nice thouch. 3. Awesome Camera, front and rear both. 4. All day battery backup on JIO 4G Network. 5. Awesome music sound. 6. Takes 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100%(which should be fast). Thanks again amazon..."
159404,mobile,This device is the best device in this price range of 11k. Pros: 1. Stock Android 2. Classy Look and Superb Built 3. Superb Camera 4. Performance Cons: 1. Battery 2. No 3.5 mm Jack Target Customers-This is meant for those customers who have less media consumption and moderate use. For them neither battery not lack of 3.5 mm Jack would be an issue.
124606,mobile,Front facing camera is super awesome.Rear camera is good. Still some improvement is possible in rear camera. The mobile contains some premium features like face unlocking in pitch dark without even pushing the power button. Screen quality is super awesome. Sound is very loud and clear. Biggest plus is mediatech helio p70 which capable for super AI processing. I can easily conclude that is purchase is best out of best within 15k segment.

120416,smartTv,"Delivery of the product in time, installation process is smooth, TV is as good as I am expecting in this price range, you can't compare a product in this range with Sony, good job sanyo."
118465,mobile accessories,Bought this mobile for my MOM and she just loved it and me toooo
120781,mobile accessories,"Display: The display is the most stunning feature of the Samsung M30.It is vibrant and simply stands out. I compared it with my POCO F1 and found it more vibrant, clear and with a punchy contrast. Processor & RAM: The processor is not up to mark when it comes to running heavy apps such as games. But for an average user like me & you who love to do calls, read message and run the basic application, the phone will be more than enough. Battery: 5000mAH battery is super awesome! It is another selling point for the phone. If you are looking for a big battery then phone is for you. also, the processor and OS are optimized for each other which makes the battey last longer. Camera: The camera works perfectly fine.You can take nice photos. OS: The good thing is that UI will help you navigate and you will eventually find the option that you are looking for. Overall rating: 9/10."
148189,mobile,Ok
167313,smartTv,awsm phone..i am using apple first time..and the experiance is great
152784,smartTv,Rate of speech cannot be altered. Specially in bedtime stories. Children don't understand the fast English. Accent is pathetic. Kids can't understand the accent. It's a good music player but poor assistant. Many a times the MIC doesn work. The biggest problem is the search. criteria. There is a lot of information which is on google that it deliberately does not pick. It searches only from amazon search engine/wikipedia.
111617,mobile,All around the phone is just mentioned in other i uses it for around 7 days but soon after that the display of phone was showing a very thin vertical line seem to be some pixel problem. I decided to return it right way thanks to Amazon they refunded by money on time and helped me . I saw many other rewies with same problem
131665,smartTv,"Great Bluetooth speaker, Great sound,Great bass...."
148541,mobile accessories,Okay I am using this product for 1 day or so and here are some of my thoughts : Pros : 1. Cheap 2. Good Bass 3. Nice call quality 4. Good battery life Cons : 1. Sound is a bit shrill 2. Bluetooth range is very less 3. Not suitable for gaming purposes
159826,smartTv,This is my second purchase for Diwali gift to my little grand daughter. Truly enjoying music listening. Superb sound quality. Excellent bass. Sound quality is so great that price doesn‚Äôt pinch. Bluetooth connectivity is very smooth and easy. JBL Connect+ is the best feature which I like most.
140665,mobile accessories,Its not up to the mark. Phn says its 6 gb ram but slows downs and even if thrs not many app on the phn. It also gets heated up soon. Screen gets white with switching btwn apps. I guess not worth 18000. Anyday go for mi product the spend is worth it.
149869,mobile accessories,Overall very good.

115260,mobile accessories,Bass and sound is good but it doesn't look like good in noise cancellation because calling doesn't feel good in rush. But i must say battery backup is more than 6 hrs for just 1.5 hrs of charging
148609,mobile accessories,"On scrutiny of the packet , the ear phone was not found. There is no INSTRUCTION LEAFLET in the packet. How do I know the function of various knobs, ports unless you provide the detail. It is really difficult for me to use it properly without knowing the function of each knob/ port. There are similar one port on each side at the bottom of the set. One gives sound , what is the function of other similar port. Regards. S.K. Ghosh M -9903922250"
151882,mobile,Product is good
132404,smartTv,Great product. Nice sound quality and nice build. The colour of the product is nice as well. On the time delivery by Amazon as expected.
130612,mobile,Good product.... It will take 10hrs to charge which means it has gud battery life....... Many says it takes too much time to charge but a 4k battery takes 2hrs to charge then calculate it for 20k.......
164653,mobile,Very useful while on vacations etc.
148485,refrigerator,"Ok ok..not that good as expected,picture quality is av,sound quality is av, looks wise ok, a little pricy, could have been better"
116302,mobile,"Been an iPhone user from 4s days , I used 4s,5c,6s+,8+ and now I bought my XR as my 8+ is broken accidentally. This is so far the best phone I used in the apple lineup. It lives upto the smoothness of apple devices and comes with the best battery life. One full charge gives me 22+ hours with 4g on all the time. I have a blue one, but all the other colours also looks super cool. They give a funky look.a lot of reviews about the screen made me think twice before I got this phone , but it‚Äôs the best LED screen ever. When it comes to gaming , it can display games in 60hz which the Samsung 9 also cannot . So the inside of the phone is definitely top in the class and worth paying for"
157614,mobile,"The fon has everything nearly good, but the wrost thing about it is its battery life, the battery donot even give backup of 5 hours with normal usage... I suggest each one of you , plZz dnt buy this, try something else The main problem is actual problem comes to light when return period is close to over, so you are only left to regret about the product and nothing else Now amazon will also not exchange it l, since its been now aprrox 20 days. And it feels like i have been cheated by amazon by faulty productüò°üò°"
167391,mobile accessories,"battery performance is up to the mark, we realise what is the meaning of 5,000 mAH.Talking about rear camera normal camera mode is very good but the wide-angle is not up to the mark. Selfie camera is also good. Regarding performance of the phone I would like to read this phone 5 out of 5. Samsung should give free install software like call recorder screen recorder."

142257,smartTv,Loved it....
110202,mobile accessories,"1. The display quality is just fabulous 2. The One UI is just amazing with lots of awesome features like night mode, blue light filter etc. The UFS 2.1 makes it very easy to open any apps in fraction of seconds 3. Camera is above average in day light and average in low light. 4. Sound quality is decent. It is not loud enough, but the clarity is crystal clear. Sound output through 3 mm jack s also very good. 5. The RAM management is very nice compared to other phones in this price segment. 6. 6000 MAH battery is very good, but Exynos 9611 processor needs more optimization. For normal usage, it might come upto one and a half day and for a heavy user, it might come for one day strictly. Screen on Time is between 6.5 to 8 hours. 7. There is no heating issue when you are in call or normal internet usage, but when you use camera or OLA or Uber continuously for 20 mins, the phone heats up. 8. The call quality is very good. No call drops. If Samsung fixes the issue of battery draining and heating issue in an update, this device would be really awesome. Overall Samsung Galaxy M30s is a very good phone with lots of features in this price segment."
144174,mobile,Nice
112171,mobile,"Amazing battery life. Even on heavy use, the battery lasts the whole day easily. Iphone XR is super smooth, face unlock is fast and really impressed with the privacy option related to apps. Best iPhone to use for its 55K price"

146677,mobile,No
150681,mobile,Phone is slim and looks good. The flip side is battery discharges faster and lasts only from morning till evening. Phone Charger has stopped working in 2 months. I am still to visit the store for replacement.
135269,mobile,"I have exchanged my oppo F3 plus and bought this mobile thinking this would be better. But after using it for more than one month I am facing a lot of issues. 1. Phones get hang some times when browsing the web, which never happened with my previous mobile. 2. Whenever taking a snap with the front camera after clicking the photo I have noticed shutter lag. It is taking 5 seconds to process the image. 3. As this mobile supports fast charging (they have claimed it supports quick charge 4.0) I have bought Quick charge 3 supporting fast charger. When I charged my mobile with quick charges the results are shocking. Quick charger took more time to charge than the supplied charger which is not a quick charger."
162924,mobile accessories,Very good
128192,smartTv,Good enjoying with iphone rather than battery life...battery life is not good for iphone

110622,mobile,A good choice for people looking for low budget phone.built quality is good and is light weight.Camera performance is average.good in daylight condition. Not impressive for low light. video quality is good and can record hd videos.sound quality is above average. Performance is very good but don't expect heavy gaming support. Expect battery life for a day usage and little more. Pros : Separate memory card slot. Potrait mode in front camera. Good battery backup. Impressive pricing. Cons : No finger print sensor. No potrait mode in rear camera.
157066,mobile,"The battery life is not so good, it barely lasts a day in on screen use of 5-6 hrs. Maybe the 90hz refresh rate is draining the battery. The camera is good during day time and without zoom. In low light it comes better with flash instead nightscape. Wide angle is good in natural day light. Face unlock and fingerprint scanner is really good. It feels a bit bulky to use."
110086,smartTv,"-> The build of the product is built of plastic but its really strong to keep the weight light, ->Good placement of the keyboard and yes its a full sized keyboard, -> The cooling is average but the fans are loud, ->Brilliant 120hz smooth display but to keep in mind it has 48hz and 120hz instead of 60z and 120hz, ->The trackpad feels weak although precise, Over all its a beast of a machine for the price of 60-70k i dont think there is a better competitors to this."

116945,mobile accessories,"Best deal if you are getting it under 1500. They are easy to use and sound quality is exceptionally good, which is least expected at this price. The built is such that they don't easily fit in any carry case especially not in the one which is mentioned in bought together catagory. The battery time is great but the info regarding the percentage battery left can be deceptive as displayed. One moment it displayes 60 % and next moment it's exhausted. But the backup is great . Can be listned for more than 4 hours when connected"

157653,mobile,The huawei health app is a joke.. Mi fit is far better and they have other custom apps too.... And so limited watch face+very small battery+wake to wrist doesn't have any customisations so it is on whole day and night too.
111334,mobile,"After eight months it stopped charging after few minutes when plugged in socket . Chinese company made in India, low quality. Provides only six months warranty. Such a reputed company providing only six month warranty is fishy enough."

133227,mobile,"Hi This is a very good product under Rs82,999 and comes with 1 YEAR WARRANTY It is the best iphone I have ever seen . it has so much new features and look is amazing. It quality and condition is good. I really loved it. Below are some features and brief description about it. BRIEF DESCRIPTION:- Design and Display How do you create a deeply intelligent device whose enclosure and display are a single, uninterrupted element? That‚Äôs the goal we first set for ourselves with the original iPhone. With iPhone X, we‚Äôve achieved it. With iPhone X, the device is the display. An all‚Äënew 5.8‚Äëinch Super Retina screen fills the hand and dazzles the eyes. The display employs new techniques and technology to precisely follow the curves of the design, all the way to the elegantly rounded corners. Front and Back Glass The front and back are all glass - the most durable we‚Äôve ever made, with a strengthening layer that‚Äôs 50% deeper. A seven-layer ink process allows for precise hues and opacity, and a reflective optical layer enhances the colors. And an oleophobic coating lets you easily wipe off smudges and fingerprints. Wireless Charging for a Wireless World We‚Äôve always intended iPhone to be a truly wireless device, free from charging cables and headphone cords. With a glass back and an embedded wireless charging system, iPhone X is designed for a wireless future. Water and Dust Resistance iPhone X is precision-engineered at the microscopic level to protect against water, splashes, and dust. OLED Designed for iPhone X The first OLED screen that rises to the standards of iPhone, with accurate, stunning colors, true blacks, high brightness, and a 1,000,000 to 1 contrast ratio Improved Cameras A larger and faster 12MP sensor. A new color filter. Deeper pixels. And a new telephoto camera with OIS. The wide-angle and telephoto cameras on iPhone X enable optical zoom, as well as digital zoom of up to 10x for photos and 6x for videos. Face ID Face ID is enabled by the TrueDepth camera and is simple to set up. It projects and analyzes more than 30,000 invisible dots to create a precise depth map of your face. So Much Technology.

159564,smartTv,This is a product review purchased from offline market and not online. So no fault of Amazon. Screen opened up automatically on one of the corners of Asus tuf fx 504 Gd worth 70000 INR. Happened this within 10 days of purchase. No replacement even after multiple follow ups. Service center repair also did not work. Screen is opening up again and inside hardware is showing Service centers are not aware of the issue. Worst customer service ever. No value for money and customers time. Guys please don't buy Asus laptops. Go for other brands

120660,mobile accessories,Display clearity is too good. Has night mode aslo for cutting harmful blue light rays to eyes. Bettry is also good. Rubber back cover also looks stylish if we put on it. I have put Black back cover and one temperd glass total it costed me around Rs200. Weight after putting back cover is also so light. Most important is it dosent heat up on ears while talking. All One plus and other mobile gets heat up on ears while talking. And Samsung service centre you will get easily everywher if any damage occurres when accidentally dropped down or any. And any mobile get drops down somehow in our regular life as we are not that much perfect in handling. Think about your current mobile how many times you have dropped it down. So don't take risk of buying other mobile. Press helpful below if you found this review helpful.

154504,mobile,"So I've been using this phone for 10days now. After intensive use I'm writing this review. First the bad part. Cons: 1. The selfie camera could've been better, it's not crystal clear like Realme or Oppo phones in this price segment. 2. The wide angle camera- If enough light is present it performs well, but when light is slightly on the lower side, the pictures come hazy. 3. Build quality- It's plastic made unibody design that's fine, but the problem is the material used here is too thin. The phone while holding it, if you press a little hard the plastic gives a clicky sound. I think Samsung could've used better plastic here. Pros: 1. The 48mp camera: This camera is better than any camera in this price segment. It has beaten Note 7Pro and Realme 5 Pro like a pro. The dynamic range, the potraits, the edge detection is fantastic. 2. Battery backup- If you're a intensive user, expect around 2days of battery life, but if you don't use your phone much, you can surely get around 2.5 to even 3days of juice without charging. 3. Display- This is the best super amoled experience I've ever had. It's buttery smooth, you won't know until you experience it. 4. Touch- It's super smooth. 5. Fingerprint and face detection- Fast and efficient. No nonsense here. 6. Gaming- This is a bit tricky part. I've tested PUBG, Asphalt 9 and both played smoothly in this phone. No heating whatsoever. PUBG in HD Smooth runs like butter, Asphalt too runs like a charm here, but in this price there are other phones which might give you a slightly better gaming performance, but hey they won't give you the mammoth battery or the rich Samsung experience. Final Verdict: If you want a overall rich experience with multimedia, performance and camera go for this phone. Use a back cover because the back is not that strong. P.S.: I got the 4/64 version for 8500/- by exchanging my Redmi 4 and using SBI debit cards and getting cashbacks."

135451,mobile,"I have received on 1st Oct, after being used for 10 days I am writing my review with pros and cons. Which may useful to decide to buy or not Pros: 1. Display amazing 2. Watched a movie with Dolby sound it's really awesome. So music experience also good 3. Sound (ring tone) audible 4.Battery is 6000 mah but not powerful as m30 of 5000 mah, but ok serve purpose of 1.5 day. 5. Powerful processor, so far didn't observe lags may be need to load apps. After that I can edit this review. 6. Both the sim slots support VOLTE, so one can use JIO sims on both. Cons: 1. Signal receiving very bad. I have honor 7x, placing side by side. This is worst in signal reciving. Due to this call drop happen almost every time even if you stand right behind call tower. I don't know it can be fixed later with patch. I feel this most important factor for mobile purchase. If it doesn't serve very basic need then it is waste of money. Rating 3 star. 3. Lot of bloatware which user doesn't not need. Most of apps doesn't have permission to delete. I think Samsung needs to improve on Primary Network issues"

So for me a rating of 3/5, suffices for this phone. -"

156887,mobile accessories,"The Mi A3 doesn't look like its predecessors, and that's a good thing. It's a bit of a stretch to access the notification panel when using the phone one-handed, but other than that it's a great size. Even though getting an AMOLED panel, the 720p resolution is just not good enough for a device in this segment. There is a camera bump at the back, with the sensor protruding slightly from the body. That leads to a wobble when using the device on a flat surface, which tends to get annoying. The in-display fingerprint reader is slow, unreliable, and just not worth the effort. When you consider the low-resolution screen, large battery, and modern soc, it‚Äôs not difficult to see why the Mi A3 offers good battery life. I easily got a full day of usage with this phone, using it mostly for browsing social media and watching YouTube videos. The Mi A3 does a fantastic job in daylight conditions, with excellent contrast levels, wide dynamic range, and accurate colors. The wide-angle lens doesn't do as good a job, but the resultant images are decent enough for sharing on social media platforms. Photos taken in low-light conditions aren't detailed enough, and there's a lot of noise, and using the dedicated night mode fixes the issue to an extent. The camera overall is pretty decent considering how much the Mi A3 costs. The best part about the Mi A3 is undoubtedly the software. Like every other Android One device, the Mi A3 has a clean user interface with no bloat ware. Positives: -Android One goodness -Premium design -Decent camera -Fantastic battery life -3.5mm jack is back Negatives: -The in-display fingerprint sensor is terrible -Low-resolution display The Mi A3 is a decent showing if you're looking for a budget Android One device, but there are plenty of other phones in the market at around the same price point that come with more features. Added some latest photos clicked after 15 days of use from Mi A3."

148810,mobile,One of the best mobile phones in this range
124448,refrigerator,"For video walkthrough go to YouTube and search ""MayHaps35"" . MY REVIEW . The Canon 1300D shares a whole lot with its well-received predecessor. Its smooth, polycarbonate body is nearly identical to that of the 1300D, and remains both friendly and approachable. . On the inside, the Canon 1300D also sports pretty much exactly the same imaging pipeline as its nearest predecessor. With a resolution of 18 megapixels from a roomy APS-C sized image sensor, the 1300D might lag more expensive cameras in terms of resolution, but it arguably provides more than enough for the entry-level shooters at whom this model is aimed. Sensitivity ranges from ISO 100 to 6400 equivalents, and can be expanded to a maximum of ISO 12,800-equivalent, which again should be plenty for the needs of most entry-level shooters (and far beyond what your cameraphone will manage). . If you're planning on shooting sports, kids or other very active subjects, however, you may want to look at a more fully-featured camera instead. With a continuous shooting speed of just three frames per second, the Canon 1300D's relatively modest burst-capture rate may leave you waiting and missing photo opportunities, especially if you're a raw shooter. You'll manage just five or six raw frames before the 1300D's buffer fills, although in JPEG mode the new DIGIC 4+ image processor now allows an unlimited burst depth. . The biggest change in the new CANON 1300D is the inclusion of both Wi-Fi and Near-Field Communications technology. Wi-Fi lets you get your images off the camera and onto your Android or iOS smartphone or tablet with ease. From there, it's just a few taps to get your photos onto social networks like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram so your friends and family can share in the moment while it's still fresh. The NFC radio, meanwhile, makes it even easier for Android users to connect their smart device to the camera. Simply bumping the two devices together is enough to create a connection and start sharing your creations. . Compared to its predecessor, the Canon 1300D now sports a higher-resolution LCD monitor. If you shoot in live view mode, that should prove handy when you want to focus manually, with the crisper display making it easier to tell precisely where the sharpest point in the image is located. And of course, the higher resolution will also make for a more satisfying experience when reviewing the photos you've already captured. . In other respects, the Canon 1300D is a whole lot like its predecessor, although some minor tweaks can be found if you look more closely. For example, the 1300D now offers a Food scene mode among the Basic Zone options on the mode dial, helping foodies to share their favorite culinary creations without needing to understand the subtleties of shutter speeds, apertures, white balance options and so forth. There's also a new ""white priority"" setting for the 1300D's auto white balance mode, which aims to better neutralize the warm color casts typical under incandescent lighting. . HOPE YOU LIKED IT :) . Check me on Instagram @not_a_photographer_though"

At this price the deal is good and the phone is great...Those who had paid rs. 11,500/- at the time of launch around 5 month before are at loss. The width of the phone screen is around 2 inch less when compared with redmi note 4 so while watching videos the display will be smaller if you are used to watching videos on big screen...I don't play games so can't comment...Good for normal everyday functioning...Video and audio quality at par with redmi note 4...Apart from face recognition, notch and dual camera nothing new.."

132987,mobile accessories,"Have used this phone and also tested the same in many areas. Overall built quality is nice but it is kinda plastici finish, enough loud in speaker and it is also good in headphones. Phone is fast due to processor (even it may be due to brand new product and not that heavily used), overall performance is very nice and impressive, but I felt little heating if used heavily / multitasked but heating is not that major to worry about. Camera quality is decent in the price range; i would say not that impressed but still it fetches decent photographs in bright sunlight,but it struggles in low light. In comparison with RealMe, this phone has lot to improve in camera processing department. But you should not expect too much in this price range. Battery performance is very decent and it will last you whole day, but it is very slow in charging, as for me it took roughly 2:30hrs to charge from zero to 100%. But overall phone is worth buying..."

158220,mobile,The phone size is big. Does not fit into the hands. The 2nd thing I didn't like is no dedicated 3.5 mm jack. Where you charge so ame place you you need to connect headphone. 3rd thing they are going the apple way of removing heand phone jack. But did not give a dedicated headphone for this type of port. Only a low quality converter. Which I am pretty sure will be worth less in 6 month. And you will be forced to take a wireless headphones. As this port phone have not even mi has a wired headphone for this. As the phone is stock Android and out of 128 gb 100 gb is available. Forget about the space or slowness. Battery last 1 day with decent calling. Heavy social media usage. But if you want to play video or listen song for long time. You need to carry the charger.

148560,smartTv,"Okay, so this is me two weeks into using the laptop. Firstly, what i love about it. 1) The design. It looks minimalistic, and it doesn't give off a gaming laptop vibe at all. But the Legion branding with the highlighted Y in the O of Legion is an excellent touch. The lid has a textured finish that looks great. If i had to nitpick, the hand rest is made of a matte finish plastic that easily picks up smudges. 2) The keyboard. It is very good to type on. It's sensitive, the keys are large and you get two levels of white backlighting which looks super clean and neat. Accidental key presses are few (this varies from person to person, obviously). 3) The mouse pad. It's great to use. It has Windows Precision Drivers and it's a breeze to use it. It has physical buttons, which i didn't like, but if you use the shortcuts, you would be rarely using them, if at all. 4) Performance. The i5 and the GTX 1650 combination work like a charm and games like GTA 5 has an average frame rate of 60 fps on medium settings. Which is pretty good for an entry level graphics card. Now that that is out of the way, let's come to things i did NOT like at all. 1) The screen. At higher brightness levels, it's awesome. But at lower brightness levels, it's too warm for my liking. It has a yellowish tinge that interferes with the viewing. 2) The THERMALS! Effing hell, Lenovo! Why did you remove manual control of the fans?! Why?! The CPU temps go as high as 96¬∞C when i run stress tests like AIDA64. And there was significant thermal throttling, like 45%. While gaming, the CPU temps went as high as 89¬∞C, and the GPU temps went to about 75¬∞C. This is not a lot, but i like my computer running cool, not toasty. The keyboard, especially near the U and P keys, become pretty warm to touch. Not uncomfortable, but I'll get a pair of gloves if my hands feel cold. Lenovo can concentrate on laptops instead of warming their users' hands. Even after undervolting the CPU to -0.15 mV (ThrottleStop), the temps remained the same, but there was less throttling seen (dropped to about 9%)... I could have gone further, but i dont want to. Yet. Haven't been frustrated by the thermal throttling to be forced to undervolt it further. What i did finally was to invest in a cooling pad (Deepwind Pal or Deepcool Pal, something along those lines). The CPU temps dropped to a cool 75¬∞C and the GPU temps were at a chill 60¬∞C while gaming. INVEST IN A COOLING PAD TO GAME! 3) The battery. It's fine, i guess. About 3 hours on minimal use, like browsing the internet, watching a movie, etc. Enable hybrid mode in Lenovo Vantage, this helps a lot. Forget about gaming on the battery. Like don't even think about it. So, there we have it. It's a great pick for it's price, but if you have relatives in the USA, ask them to get the y540 from Walmart or some other big chain store. For the same price, i.e. 60k, you can get the GTX 1660Ti and the 144 Hz screen from there. Ask them to unbox it and get it as their personal laptop so that they don't have to pay any customs duty."

158882,mobile,The update of miui 11 is coming to these redmi note 5 pro. the intenal features are too good with good prosesor and the camera .
124230,refrigerator,"First things first. I'll tell you how to enable samsung pay. You need to change the watch region to US. It's a setting but cannot be directly done from the watch. Look up in google how to do that. Battery: I use always on watch face and it gives me around 36+ hours on full charge. Water resistance: I've been in heavy rain countless number of times. Till now, no issues."
153373,mobile,"Redmi Note 5 Pro is genuinely the best mid-range smartphone offering best in quality with elegant design. It works flawlessly almost 90% of time. I categorize smartphone brand into two categorize: one with limited feature with top quality for which cost is on higher side & Second are those who offer n numbers of feature but diluting the quality. But Xiaomi is a hybrid version of both offering good number of feature & also maintaining that quality factor. Pros: 1. Battery lasts 1-3 days backed with 4000 mAh battery. 2. 12MP+5MP Dual Rear camera with Portrait mode, HD Resolution 3. Aderno 509 GPU offering 18:9 full screen resolution 4. 2.5D Curved gorilla glass 5. IR Remote for TVs, AC, Setup Box and more 6. Finger Print & Face Unlock 7. Dual speakers on Bottom of Phone Cons: 1. Mi SMS does not support Gif in text (Switched to Google SMS) 2. Flash is just enough for photos. 3. No Unnecessary apps pre installed but once you update your smartphone it will definitely come Opinion: 1. Get a better back cover don't rely on the complimentary back cover you get. 2. I suggest to safeguard your camera by lens cover as it has camera bumb which might scratch you camera lens thus destroying your camera. I have faced such issue with my moto g4 plus phone. 3. Install Swift key keyboard Fun Fact: Earlier we have seen trolls showing Xiaomi phone work as iron press because of heating effect. I guess they have taken this feedback too seriously :p"

168621,mobile accessories,i love this phone
134312,mobile,"I bought this mobile for battery life and I'm absolutely happy that this mobile could last more than a day beyond my extensive usage(6-8 hours of calls & multiple business apps). Thanks a lot @Samasung for the battery beast. I had Redmi A2 earlier, which use to last hardly a day with full charge. Comparatively screen quality is quite impressive than A2. Its been a fortnight usage, Over all experience is 4.5/5 considering camera quality, processing speed and fingerprint reader. I haven't tested with fast charging but it takes 2 hrs to charge from 10 - 100% with box charger. I would suggest to go with this if you are looking for battery life budget mobile with all required features like ""fingerprint scanner, good battery life"" etc. Cons: 1.No NFC support so contactless transactions not possible. If you are serious about contactless payment just think. 2.No on screen fingerprint reader and in this budget segment with all features and back side reader, this is ok. 3. With given charger it takes time to charge mobile so we may need to buy a fast charger separately. 4. No ear phones in box, we have option to buy desired headset than getting a basic ear phones."
163661,smartTv,"Very good seller, product work Good"

118455,smartTv,"Bought this in 2019‚Äôs Great India Festival. Switching from a 32 inch Vu LED Tv, the experience has been great. Ultra HD 4K TV, that too from Samsung, stands out in picture clarity. Another huge plus is Samsung‚Äôs sound quality which you‚Äôll never get from cheaper Chinese/Indian counterparts, although one drawback is the missing dolby config. Picture is great, but a refresh rate of 60 Hz is noticeable when things move fast. But then again, all the TVs in this range come at this frequency. Remote is with a lot of unnecessary keys. I‚Äôm still fine with it, but my parents find a hard time trying to find online content like Netflix. To sum up, pros outweigh the cons and, yes, it‚Äôs a good call to pick this instead of a 30K Vu TV or an Mi TV."

Battery life is really good with 5000mAh with C-type charger which helps to charge the phone fast . It has a amazing camera quality with dual camera lens and ultra wide rear camera . Samsung M20 has a Infinity-V display . Nice mobile. Battery was holding up to 1.5 day with a high usage . (For myself) playing games , communication , face talks etc etc . Features are also nice . Update is possible when the phone is used for first time . Well done samsung . And great work by amazon . Storage 64 gb ( 14.1 fb for Internal os) it can be expandable up to 512 and 4 gb ram gives best performance . Hd display 16 cm screen .Was nice touch is good .

137073,refrigerator,"I was fed up with the amount of dust that the sensor of my Nikon D7100 was picking up and the number of times I was having to get it cleaned so was torn between getting shot of all my gear and moving to Canon, upgrading to the D7200 or looking at what was new to market. The D5600 had just been released and on paper looked amazing, so I decided to 'downgrade' to what is classed as a beginners camera. The camera was poorly packed by Amazon in a box that had a bare minimum of those air filled bags around it, so was rattling around inside the box and on opening it up it was obvious that the camera had been unpacked and packed back in the box again at sometime as the battery wasn't even in any plastic packing or where it should have been in the box. Like other buyers the camera came with a Europe two pin plug charger and no instruction book, but I took my first photo and loaded the photo into Picasa to view he shutter count and it showed a count of 1, so even though it looked as if the camera had been handled no pics had been taken before I took mine. I've purchased a genuine Nikon three pin charger plug for 1500 and have downloaded a PDF of the manual from the Nikon website to make my purchase complete. Now for the positives, this camera is so light, the lightest SLR I've ever owned, it's lighter than some mobile phones I've owned, well balanced in my hand and had a good sized grip, I'm over 6ft so have very big hands and it doesn't feel like a toy at all. Having owned several Nikon DSLRs the controls and handling is natural, nothing new to get my head around, the LCD is large and clear, and covers lots of angles so I can shoot over crowds. The main selling feature of this camera is Snapbridge, once it's set up on your phone it really does work, Nikon have tried it with adaptors in the past that were hit and miss but they've nailed it this time, I shot with the camera and the photos are on my phone and I can post straight to Instagram, my Instagram followers must wonder what's going on! The 18-55 VR lens with the kit is turning out some crystal clear images and like the camera is amazingly light, focusing is quick and sharp. I've only had the camera for a week, but so far so good, let's hope I don't see the same sensor dust problems that the D7100 suffered with.

124188,smartTv,"First of all, I want to make it clear, I‚Äôm not trying to put down this TV. I still happy to have it. For me It worth its price, because I bought Mi Box TV. I‚Äôm using this TV 3 weeks. It has problems as a SMART-TV (big or small you can decide by yourself -). After power lost, it forgets about wi-fi network selection. Every time you have to switch it form wire connection which is default in settings. Netflix show only SD ‚Äì it‚Äôs like a pain. If you try to update Netflix (it asks to do so) ‚Äì it stop working and you have to install previous version. You can‚Äôt setup user picture settings if you watching digital content like Youtube, Netflix, Amazon or USB-Stick. User settings works only for external (HDMI, Coaxial) ports. For me default sharpening is too much, brightness is to dark, aggressive dynamic contrast is on, and you can do nothing with it in the main mode of this SMART-TV. There is no local network in built in media player which can play 4K-videos smooth without fame skipping. I installed VLC player, which has network, but it skips frames on good HD and especially 4K videos (even from usb-stick). So, by now you can‚Äôt see 4K content by LAN without frame skipping. There is no Google Play store. Just two unofficial stores with tiny fraction of apps, which is not always working as expected. There are no other languages in screen keyboard. Google Keyboard (GBoard) is not working ‚Äì crash on start. So, you can‚Äôt find for example music or video in other languages. There is a frame drops on Youtube on good quality 4K videos (you can see it without any measure and also by debug statistic). Remote works with interruptions. In hardware keyboard Enter-key is not working as intended. Instead it prints some symbol. The keys of keyboard are sticky too often. So, you priiiinttttingg like thhhis. The interface has lags. The backlight is not very uniform. In the corners it‚Äôs darker (see the photos). You cannot regulate volume of the SP-DIF sound from TV-remote. The internal sound from TV is continue to play (with delay) if you use external sound, so you should put it on zero-volume. If you like VA-kind of panels, I recommend to use this TV as video-panel. You can buy MI TV-box or Fire Stick. Cheap and best! My experience with delivery it‚Äôs a particular story, it was not good. First time I received TV with huge crack on it. Looks like somebody try to pull TV up from box by pushing to the panel. Second time I receives already opened box with mess inside and already used TV. It was not all packing boxes inside, no bolts for table stand, screws are in wall stucco, no dowels. I bought bolts for table stand by myself, because I didn‚Äôt want to wait another month for one more exchange. Update: It drops the ""dynamic contrast"" user setting for HDMI port each time after each power up. It always turns on (however settings show as ""off"", and you have to switch on/off to really turn it off -- annoying)."

157908,smartTv,"The performance is good and works like a charm and with the 128 GB SSD it boots faster and still now I didn't find any performance lag and also the cooling fan control is customizable for 3 levels .4K video playing is also good and not bad.only thing which I had problem was with my Lap is there a creeking sound when I open and close the laptop lid ,it comes from the hinge so replaced the laptop and it took more than 7 days to replace and repetitive calls to customer care but every thing is fine and this review is after the usage of 1 month"

I can play 720P quality videos without any lags. Its pretty good and the experience is awesome. The only drawback i felt was, the installation service provided by Amazon. I received the TV on Nov 2nd and the installation service executive told that slot is available only on Nov 8th. I don't know why would they need 6 days. Luckily installation wasn't hard and i did it myself I would recommend Amazon to change the installation service partner because I could see lot of complaints about the installation."

122629,mobile accessories,"Excellent phone as promised. Before purchasing the phone, my main concerns (based on other reviews) were the camera and the notch. My previous phones were of Sony and Google, so the camera on the OnePlus 7 is not upto the mark. But that is probably the only downside and one that does not matter a lot to me personally. And the notch is a bit annoying -I have opted to 'Hide the notch' in the Settings. Amazing battery life- 7.5 hours of screen time & quick charging, gameplay experience is great, best speakers on a phone I have experienced (sometimes a bit too loud). On-screen fingerprint reader is very good but it does struggle when the phone is on a table - i have to pickup the phone in my hand to best position my thumb. The phone, both the rear and the screen, is very prone to fingerprint smudges. Holding my old Google Nexus in one hand and the OnePlus 7 in the other hand, I definitely feel the OnePlus to be more 'sticky'. Need to constantly wipe the screen and use a case for the back."

The words are legible and the paper is of high grade with no compromise on quality anywhere to be seen and the publisher done an awesome job Fingerprint publishing. Conclusion : Go with a blind eye for this one and you will not be regretted. Thank you for your patience in reading my review"

160940,smartTv,Tomorrow im going to consumer court to giving complain against your company
164661,mobile,Very useless product. Battery very poor. Can you use With in halftime the battery comes down to 50%.The 4gb Ram also not performing fast.They told 64gb storage devices. But it's only 58gb.
152424,mobile accessories,"Pros: > Display is very cool. On par with flagship phones. > Battery life is great. > Camera quality is fair, comparing it with previous generation samsung phones. > Touch is very smooth. Much smoother than the competition redmi note 7 pro. And also a better display than the same. > fast charger is included in the box! > Widevine L1 certified, so you can watch shows and youtube videos in HD. > really good fast charging. Goes from 10 to 100 percent in 2 hours, and then lasts 2 days with moderate usage. Even a quick 10 minutes charge will help you keep your phone alive for the rest of your day. > triple camera setup with a wide angle lens for great landscape pictures. Cons > processor not powerful enough. Not a good choice for hardcore gamers. But you can play games on low quality. > night camera is okayish. Could have been better. > no 4k video, not even 60fps option in the videos, so there is no slowmo either. > Aspect ratio is a bit odd. Videos are slighty zoomed in on apps. Even instagram stories are slightly zoomed in to fit on screen. There must be a way to change it but I have yet to discover the setting. > No gorilla glass and polycarbonate back. Both sides are prone to scratches. But it if: You are a student and spend a lot of time on phone studying and taking notes. If you want to watch shows online and youtube in good quality. If you want a phone that lasts long (in terms of battery). Don't buy if you want a high-performance phone. Rating: 8/10. The phone is good for its price. You won't get this display at this price in any other phone. The battery and fast charging are a nice addition."
140175,mobile accessories,It's very good. I must say best in this range. It's better than jbl c100si. Balanced sound. Very good. And most imp thing it does not give pain to ear at all. No sound distortion at full volume also. U can buy it for sure.

147164,mobile,"Not a good decision to buy, extremly bad battery. This price should provide better battery and Other features. Battery is draining like hell, i have to charge twice a day, even i am not all day mobile user."
158952,mobile accessories,"There are a few things that annoy smartphone users the most, the trade-off between cost, features and brand recognition before buying a phone. Samsung hits third one with no issues, but when finding the best sweet spot between cost and features, it struggled. With brands like Xiaomi capturing the market with phones hitting the cost versus features sweet spot, samsung was lacking. But with samsung m30s, it tackled all the smartphones in that segment. Awesome battery life - have been using it for quite sometime and easily serves 2 full days with seldom to moderate use. Awesome camera quality - A DSLR equivalent for quarter the price! It beats any phone in this segment. Seamless UI - samsung is known for its versatile and seamless 'one UI' is fast and user friendly. Monster display- The sAMOLED display is in the face and makes it look like a flagship featured phone. I was little concerned about the weight of the phone because of it packing a big battery, but I was wrong. There is little to no difference compared to my previous phone. The only thing and it can be very trivial, is the finger print reader. Little slower than usual but barely noticeable. In a nutshell, It is a phone that is worth your money."

124819,mobile accessories,Gets overheated and then keeps on restarting on its own. I actually had to keep it in freezer for few minutes to avoid the processor to burn out. One more drawback is that while in pocket the finger print automatically unlocks the phone and unknowing does things on its own. So please dont buy this phone. Its very poor mindless design by samsung

136641,books,"I re-read this book after 20 years, and I believe I got it this time around. First time, I was looking for a magic formula, and I didn't really see any. This time, I realised that it was staring me in the face - it was my own mind, my own way of thinking that needed change. There are so many ways to financial security, and to getting out of the rat race, one just needs to be aware, gain knowledge and act in time - without following the herd. I'm starting my journey now, and I shall come back to this book after a few years, to see how much I've improved. Krishnakumar"

Battery: More than expectation, NO Heating Issue experienced. Camera (Back): Good..in this range. Camera (Front) In outdoor and sun light its good, in dark its ok clarity of photo's we can.

OVERALL I AM VERY MUCH HAPPY TO GET THIS KIND OF MOBILE WITH SUPERIOR FEATURE, MODEL, NAUTCH LOOK,AND UPDATED VERSION MOBILE IN THE MARKET. Thanks to Amazon for Fabulous Offers. And Thanks to MI for introducing such handset in economy range."
157265,mobile accessories,"The biggest departure from previous Samsung designs is the waterdrop-style 'Infinity-V' notch at the top of the screen, which is just big enough for the front camera to fit into. The screen measures 6.3 inches diagonally with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and rounded corners in keeping with current trends. There is a bit of a chin at the bottom of the screen ‚Äî interestingly, if you place the Galaxy M20 and Galaxy M10 side by side, you'll see that they look identical except that the Galaxy M20 has a taller screen and narrower chin, for a screen-to-body ratio exceeding 90 precent. The rear and sides of this phone are a single moulded shell with no seams or even antenna lines. We're happy to note that despite being glossy, the rear of this phone isn't slippery at all. The sides of this phone are rounded, but it is bulky overall, thanks to the 5000mAh battery ‚Äî more on that in a bit. It's also quite thick and heavy, and we felt the weight after using it for extended periods. The Galaxy M10 is a lot lighter in comparison but it obviously doesn't have the huge battery. The Galaxy M20 has a USB Type-C port on the bottom, unlike the Micro-USB port on its less expensive sibling. The speaker grille is also on the bottom, whereas the Galaxy M10 has it on the lower rear. Another big difference between the two phones is that the Galaxy M20 has a fingerprint sensor on the rear ‚Äî the less expensive model doesn't have one at all. We found the sensor a bit too high for our index fingers to reach comfortably when holding the phone. Everything else is fairly standard ‚Äî there's a 3.5mm audio socket on the bottom, power and volume buttons on the right, and a tray on the left for two Nano-SIMs as well as a dedicated microSD card slot. The dual rear camera module has a tiny ridge around it to help prevent the lenses from getting scratched, but doesn't protrude at all. The most interesting thing on the Galaxy M20's spec sheet is its brand new Exynos 7904 processor. The Galaxy M20 is available with either 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, or 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The screen resolution is 1080x2340, with a density of 409ppi. There's a 5000mAh battery, and Samsung says that the bundled 15W charger will fill it up quickly. Ten minutes of charging is supposed to be enough to enjoy three hours of videos or 11 hours of music playback.The primary rear camera is a 13-megapixel unit with an f/1.9 aperture, while the secondary camera has a 5-megapixel sensor and 120 degree field of view. The front camera has an 8-megapixel resolution."

It also has many new modes compared to my old phone like the Dolby atmos mode , the blue light filter, the smart view mode and the night mode which are really useful . I also liked the battery life which lasts long and it also comes with a fast charger which is very useful . It has face recognition and also a fingerprint sensor which are really useful for security . Overall I would like to call it ""THE BUDGET PHONE"""

Overall highly recommend and very much satisfied."
136631,smartTv,"I purchased this tv after seeing the review from techiebeez on youtube. The review was really good. I am writing the review after using it for nearly two months. As you know the TV has inbuilt soundbar which is very good, Which is rare in other TVs at this price. I have a Samsung Tv sound bar with 5.1 channel DTS, this sound bar fits right under the TV. Tv has got 2.5 inches of space after putting it on stands, where you can easily keep your external soundbar. TV length is 4feet and 1 inch. The distance between the two stands is about 3feet 8 inches. Each stand width is 10 inches, so your tv table width should be at least 11 inches and length 4feet. Tv picture quality:- Is very very good, please go through the youtube video to enable HDR enhancer and 4K settings. people often complain about the refresh rate is 60 Hz, this is not a problem because tata sky HD telecast is at 1080/50 Hz. You need more than 60Hz if you are playing games with PlayStation. Smart TV features:- Is also good, You can watch videos in 4K from youtube, not many TVs has got this feature. You can install amazon prime externally If you are not satisfied with the installed one. I don't watch things on the internet. All in all, this is a very good tv which is made in India. Please don't forget to buy an extended warranty after installing Shinco App on your mobile."

110051,books,"Think and Grow Rich' by Napoleon Hill, takes an in depth look at the power of the mind and personal belief and how these influence our success. Hill uses examples of past success such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford and Thomas Edison to show how factors such as desire, the subconscious mind, faith and goals can interweave to create favorable condition for success. The title of this book can be quite deceiving. I thought it would be a get rich quick book but was pleasantly surprised. Hill used timeless principles to illustrate the power of the mind, visualization and channeling our desires to attaining financial greatness. While the book was written many years ago, the principles demonstrated here in fact serve as guides to modern day self-help programs and books. The chapter on autosuggestion showing how we have the power to direct our minds toward achieving a certain goal fascinated me. Hill shows how the mind cannot differentiate between truth and falsehood, we simply need to instruct or manipulate it toward a certain mode. This is a must read for everyone, regardless of your professional background. The insight you receive here will help you move from procrastination and fear to actualizing your goals."

136547,smartTv,I purchased my firestick on 15th Jan 2019 just before the launch of firestick with Alexa new voice remote. It was not bad luck but I feel ditched about Amazon's crude strategy that they gave me 500 discount on the old version remote enabled firestick. Had I known I would have definitely gone for new version. I totally agree with other reviewers who feels that Amazon should buy back/replace old remote at least for those who are still in warranty. I guess expecting this gesture from Amazon is not much of a asking.

Very vibrant colours combination. 2. Battery- it's huge advantage to have battery of this size, no matter how heavily u use it, it will never disappoint u for whole day. Normal user will get more than one day backup. 3. Speed- u can not match it with apple or other high end phone, but in this range u can't have better than this. Simply one of the best in this bracket. Camera- will not disappoint u. One of the best in distance and close shots. Sound- quality could have been better, though loaded with Dolby atmos. This can be overcome by using a good earphone as it's not supplied with phone. Overall- it's body has metal finish, which gives rich feel, but it doesn't matter much as people are using back cover."
168475,mobile,"hey Guy's, I ordered SAMSUNG M30s on 29 Sep and arrived next day. I couldn't use this Mobile 5 days after getting it due to I traveled to a village where I won't get any WiFi or network properly so, kept it in box and started using it after 5 days. Trust me guys this is my honest feedback after using 5 to 8 days, this mobile is having lot of NETWORK issues. I'm not able to call to anyone now. I kept in Flight mode twice to refresh the network and unable to call later restarted mobile and tried to call again didn't work. the below are issues which I have faced with in short span of time of usage. 1. The very 1st day mobile got hanged couple of seconds while installing apps and mobile is not responding quickly, waste of having 6GB of RAM. 2.When I was in call meanwhile got call from whatsapp then automatically speaker turned on and not able to turn it off and continued the call till end with speaker only, started talking in whatsapp after sometime only able to turned off the speaker 3.kept Do not Disturb mode for sometime so got missed call notification so, tried to call it back after turning off the DO NOT DISTURB mode now not able to call to the number, it is giving beep sound for 2 seconds later no sounds getting disconnected automatically, now I'm in a mood to hit the mobile on the ground. I'm not a gamer and I don't take pics much, for normal usage purpose only I bought this mobile, previously I used redmi note 3 mobile only, so as I want a change in mobile bought this WORST one, now I'm regretting...REDMI is far better than SAMSUNG. I bought this mobile because of brand only, now I don't have any confidence on SAMSUNG Don't feel regret after buying it, better to buy any other one instead of wasting money on this scarp. what is the use of the battery or screen or ram or camera when you are not able to call a person in need. If there is negative rating I would have given -1000 to it. Totally disappointed with this product, now plan to talk to AMAZON to return it, as I've crossed no of days to return this product."

Brand : Samsung ( already established and one of the best brands) Price : reasonable Build quality : based on the price, it is upto the mark. Camera : 48 mega pixel ( what else you are expecting in this price) Memory : All kind of variants ( I bought 128 GB not much difference in price so I go with 128) Battery Capacity : 6000( compare to other phones way more sustainable. This is one of the important thing for us. Because at last after 1-2 years durability and sustainability of battery matters for us) Extra memory slot for unlimited storage. Best for gaming and watching movies ( i watch 3-4 movies with one go with full charging) I know processor is not snapdragon flag ships but still it's not bad.

But these are minor occurrences. Great value for money. Great TV. Great quality overall at this price."

The camera quality is not as good as expected though, and the phone even in mint condition, does not have a smooth UI. Build quality is great however. The battery life is good as well. It does have connectivity issues as well. Hopefully using a 4G sim will fix it. :)"

In just 17k bucks numerous features are given. The most determental thing that it has 6000mah battery with type C fast Charging and trust me it gets charged 50 charged in 15-20 minutes. Screen look is too good Super Amoled. Coming to the camera I compared its camera with Oneplus 6T and I found it has more clear and defined pictures than a 40k bucks phone. Searching a phone under 17 thousand buy this."

Best thing: Camera: Live option is pretty cool,Battery, Fingerprint. Processor speed Bad thing : it's been a month and am yet to find one. Cool. Just buy and you gonna love the user interface. Coz I am using android also, last week one of my colleague gave her Lenovo to download some app, I must say I took 5 minutes to find play store in that phone.

After complaining again, amazon arranged next inspection, but this time the same guy was assigned adn he didn't even come to my place and completed the request with same message as "" No issue in the phone"" From past three four days I am calling Amazon to get this resolved but no proper action taken yet.

158352,smartTv,"The product and the packaging was in perfect condition. I ordered this from E-mobiles. I've also checked the IMEI number on the Apple website to ensure that the product is genuine. I have encountered few issues with the delivery so that's why I rated this 4. But coming to the product, everything is perfect. Putting on the case will avoid any scratches as the matte black version is also very smooth, feels great in the hand but also fragile. I would strongly recommend if you are buying this on Amazon to opt for an early delivery."
134892,smartTv,"I got the package MI tape UNSEALED but the normal taping was done. So I am suspecting it was a returned piece. Leaving that fact. It has good picture quality and overall build is OK. Being an Android tv it don't have all basic apps like Netflix, prime and voot etc on play store which is strange. But can be sideloaded(installed from USB). The software still have glitches but updates might sort it later. screen mirroring is little complicated but I havent got my S8 mirrored yet(tried all ways) No Doubt it is a good TV but has few defects which can be cured by coming updates. Let me say it again- Picture Quality is Good for which i was confused earlier."

135381,mobile,"I have purchased 4gb/64gb opal black variant. After placing the order, got it delivered within 24 hours. I wasn't expecting much from this device within this price range. Design & Body : Fibre body but feels premium with amazing color and design. Display : By default display doesn't look like superAmoled. User need to change the screen mode from Natural to Vivid, then it becomes feast to the eyes. Battery : Even With the monstrous 6000mAh battery this device doesn't feel heavy and performs with it's full potential. Camera: If you expect that camera will click super crisp and awesome images without any efforts then you will not appreciate the quality that M30s produces. Every hardware needs equally good software to produce good output. Same goes with the Samsung Galaxy M30s's camera. For better quality images you just need to learn how to use its camera app and it will never disappoint you. Finger Print : Finger print sensor is very fast and responsive. Processor: Exynos 9611 octa-core chipset based on a 10nm process gives smooth experience while playing games. Final Conclusion : It's a value for money device with this price range. The only thing I was expecting was there must be screen guard and normal silicon back cover included inside the box."

The usp of this phone is it's battery, Great battery life it will give you around 1 and half day usage if you are a average user. 3. Great camera, saturation is nice and not overexposed pictures. Good camera. 4. Gaming performance is very good. But let me clear i am not a gammer, so for me the performance is very good. 5. One UI is best. Top class ram management and very great UI. 6. Before update the fingerprint was laggy but after October update the fingerprint became faster than before Cons: 1. Night mode is not too good. But yeah does the job. 2. Sometimes at ultrahd pubg lags. 3. In 48 MP camera mode it takes time to save. 4. Littlte bit heating issue after playing PUBG at ultrahd."

110641,mobile accessories,A good phone for the price. The silver lining in this phone is that its an Android One phone which will get all the updates at the earliest. There's no skin and the pure android experience is a joy to use. However the fingerprint scanner needs further refinement.

133138,refrigerator,"Here are some shots taken from the camera using a 70-300 mm lens. Hope you like it. Regarding the picture quality it surely hits the bull's eyes. Nikon's 'advanced beginner' DSLR, the D5300 takes the D5200's place between the entry-level D3200 and the enthusiast-targeted D7100 in the company's APS-C lineup. The D5300 offers a 24MP sensor (like its 24MP APS-C stablemates), an articulated rear LCD, and more physical controls than the D3200, but without the twin-dial interface and professional-grade AF system of the decidedly higher-market (and much more customizable) D7100. Both visually and ergonomically the D5300 is a near-clone of its predecessor (it's fractionally lighter and a tiny bit smaller), but under the hood it is a stronger camera in a couple of important ways. The D5300's 24MP sensor lacks an anti-aliasing filter, which - consistent with our experiences testing the D7100 and D800E - gives it the edge in terms of resolution over the D5200. The difference is subtle (especially with a kit zoom attached), but it's always nice to see improvements to critical image quality potential, especially in mid-range models. The D5300 also offers a beefed-up video mode, which is now capable of true 1080/60p HD video. This, plus the slightly widened (3.2"" compared to 3"") fully-articulated 1.04 million-dot LCD screen, should mean that the D5300 will be attractive to videographers as well as stills photographers. Easy to miss, but useful features include built-in Wi-Fi and GPS - both firsts for Nikon's DSLR lineup. Battery life gets a boost too: according to CIPA figures the D5300 offers an endurance of 600 shots, compared to 500 from the D5200. Remember, though, that this figure does not take features like Wi-Fi or GPS into account, and using them will shorten the amount of time you can spend shooting. The Nikon D5300 can easily be classified as an iterative update, providing only a handful of features that weren't present in its D5200 predecessor. It speaks volumes about the D5200 that adding only a few more things amounts to an APS-C DSLR with 24 megapixels, no optical low pass filter, 1080/60p HD video recording, a fully articulated display and built-in Wi-Fi. In terms of on-paper specifications, the the D5300 looks 'fully loaded.' The main feature we really wish it offered is a touchscreen LCD. We've come to appreciate being able to perform certain actions by touch on competing cameras, particularly things like exposure compensation and AF point placement in live view mode. We'd also like to see twin control dials - something Nikon has traditionally saved for its more expensive models, but some of its competitors offer at this price point. Nikon D5300 key features 24.1MP DX format CMOS sensor, without OLPF EXPEED 4 processing ISO 100-12,800 standard, up to 25,600 expanded 5 fps continuous shooting 39-point AF system, 9 sensors cross-type 2016-pixel RGB metering sensor 1080p60 video recording, built-in stereo mic 1.04M dot 3.2"" vari-angle LCD monitor Key specs compared to the Nikon D5200 The table below shows how the major specifications of the D5300 compare against the D5200. As you can see, Nikon has updated a couple of core specifications, but the differences aren't huge. Nikon D5300 Nikon D5200 Sensor resolution (type) 24MP CMOS (no OLPF) 24MP CMOS Autofocus System 39 AF points (9 cross-type) ISO sensitivity 100-12,800 (H1 expansion up to 25,600 equiv) 100-6400 (H2 expansion up to 25,600 equiv) Display size / resolution 3.2"", 1.04M-dot vari-angle 3"", 921k-dot vari-angle Maximum framerate (DX mode) 5 fps Movie Mode 1080 60p/30p 1080 60i/30p Battery life (CIPA) 600 shots 500 shots Dimensions 125 √ó 98 √ó 76 mm (4.9 √ó 3.9 √ó 3.0 in) 129 x 98 x 78 mm (5.1 x 3.9 x 3.1 in) Weight (without battery) 480 g (16.9 oz) 505 g (17.8 oz) Compared to the rest The D5300 may look good in comparison with its predecessor and Canon's equivalent model, but there are other options worth considering, beyond the two big brands. In terms of DSLRs, Ricoh's Pentax K-50 offers twin control dials, a weather sealed body and a larger viewfinder. If you're willing to look at mirrorless models, the Olympus OM-D E-M10 offers twin dials, a touch-screen, built-in Wi-Fi and an electronic viewfinder, all in a package considerably smaller than the Nikon. Panasonic, Fujifilm and Samsung also make competitive models for a similar price, so it's worth considering which capabilities you do and don't need, before committing to one of the big two."

142729,refrigerator,"Mi Band3 is as useful as you can make it since it gives features that help you decide to take control of your health parameters. My first band so review is relative. However the key cost that comes with it is battery life or frequent charge expected. Started using this since 29oct18. 1. Fully charged on 29Oct. Reached 83% in 19 hrs. 2. As a starter setting up initial params so tapped screen at least 100 times in 19 hrs . I used initially to check step counter often. 4 times checked heart rate which seemed accurate. 3. Pedometer is NOT counting steps accurately yet. Maybe will over 2,3 days but thats an issue. Step counter depends on sensor detecting any movement, not just stride. Showed 4k steps within 18 hrs which is NOT right. 4. HRM initially was checked manually 4 times. After 18 hrs setup was done to monitor HR continuously. Batt consumption expected high in continuous mode. 5. External Screen guard - dont buy any product which is not required. Screen guards for Mi Band 3 is not worth it. 6. MiFit app is a good support tool. But data consumed,logged is huge so needs to be managed properly. The location of the data and log files is crucial. 7. It measures steps in your sleep too."

153643,mobile,"Samsung Galaxy M30s has a good display, and watching content on it was a pleasant experience. It gets bright enough outdoors and I did not have issues with sunlight legibility. The Exynos 9611 powering the smartphone is capable of delivering a smooth experience without any hiccups. I could navigate through the menus and launch apps without any stutters. The fingerprint scanner is also quick to unlock the smartphone and did not require multiple attempts. There is face recognition as well, and the smartphone is quick to unlock after a successful scan. Battery life is the highlight of the Galaxy M30s and the 6,000mAh battery does help this smartphone soldier on for a very long time before it needs to be plugged in. I could go on for 1.5 days with my usage involving an active WhatsApp account, taking camera samples, and playing about 40 minutes of YouTube.When the battery does run out, the supplied 15W charger is capable of charging the phone to 22 percent in 30 minutes, and up to 43 percent in an hour. Charging the phone completely takes about two and a half hours. Pros:- ‚Ä¢Crisp AMOLED display ‚Ä¢Great battery life ‚Ä¢Decent performance ‚Ä¢Good camera performance in daylight Cons: ‚Ä¢Camera is slow to focus ‚Ä¢Spammy notifications Review after 3 days of usageüôÇ"

137256,mobile accessories,"I would say wow for this awesome mobile.. Pros: Camera: Front camera is awesome, Realme gives you a premium front camera on a mid range smartphone. It blurs the background and gives you a better portrait mode than rear camera. Front camera gives you a bright and clear picture even in low light without requiring a front flash. Battery Backup: It has a decent battery backup, im using this mobile for over a week now and I didn't find the battery to be disappointing, for a normal usage it lasts for 1.5 days easily and on heavy usage it lasts for 1 day. Performance: It has a normal performance, it will not disappoint you but yes it has an average performance not too fast but till now it never gave me any problem in terms of performance. Looks: This is the major reason why people would prefer buying this smartphone, believe me U1 has premium built quality, attractive shining bright colours and no one can say that its a mid range smartphone by its looks. Unlocking: This is the best thing which I loved about U1. Face unlock is the best it also works in low light, I have used oneplus 5t and face unlock is the same on both the smartphones. Everything is outstanding at this price.. Believe me you'll not get all this on a different smartphone for this price. If I compare, what vivo is giving for 21k, you are getting those features in 12k (Looks, camera, batter life and other features) If you are looking for performance please purchase oneplus, it has best performance in the market. Cons: I dont wish to mention it personally but just want you guys to know that it doesn't have fast charging. There are no other cons.. Overall its a best smartphone for this price and"

153630,mobile accessories,Samsung Galaxy M30 is a decent product of you want to buy a handset below 14k. It is the best product of you're looking for a handset with strong and attractive UI. The camera is not bad. Music sounds great with Dolby Atmos Surround Sound. Battery life is remarkable as it is usable for more than 24 hours dependinb upon the usage.Exynos Processor is a major drawback of the phone unless you don't use your phone extensively. Go for it if you're not a gamer and extensive mobile user.

135092,mobile accessories,"I have always been a Samsung user and am always appreciating Samsung for their amazing services. I was looking for a new device and I was very head bent on the Samsung M30 the day I saw it. I am using the 4 + 64GB version in blue and it works just so well!! I am very happy with my device and recommend it to everyone looking for something in the price range. The 50000 mAh battery is just so helpful and very rare in mobiles, with normal usage on Wifi I get upto 3 full days of battery backup! And also you can fully charge the phone with the fast charger from 0 to 100 in just 2-3 hrs! The features are just unlimited and the device feels actually premium to use. An added feature of Samsung is that the phone damage can be repaired almost anywhere you are and it won't even cost you much. Plus Samsung is both, durable and reliable, even with the 4GB RAM I can play games with a lot of clarity! The device also doesn't heat up! The screen is vivid and almost every setting can be customized very easily and effectively for every person. The Samsung in-built apps might seem like a burden, but if you turn off the notifications, they're really helpful in gaming and multitasking! I have never experienced any system error in this device, if I have got any, it is due to some error I made, for which I was helped by the Samsung online chat service step by step. Samsung phones also have many many in-built features like antivirus, automatic cache memory cleaner and device booster that improve the performance of the product. With smart view one can connect easily to almost any TV set for screen mirroring. And the camera quality is just so cool! I don't even need to search for wallpapers, I can easily just take out my phone, look for a scene I like and click! Whatever I say is less, this phone is a must buy! The best choice ever!!"

135163,mobile,"I have been using the m30s for a week and I wanted to share my review 1) Look:- the phone looks and feels good. It has a gradient blue-green finish at the back which looks cool. Even though this phone is 188 gms it feels comfortable in hand and the weight management is excellent. 2) Display:- The display panel of this phone is beautiful. It has a super amoled screen with good brightness level and I have no issue in viewing in direct sunlight. These days the notch is in trend with every phone, this phone comes with infinity U-notch. I personally don't like notches but as it has an amoled display you could resize while watching videos and would not get obstructed by the notch also being amoled Display the pixels would be off thus saving your battery. 3) Rear camera:- The rear camera photos are good with adequate lighting and sharpness, but the quality disrupts when you zoom in. 4) Battery:- The battery capacity is huge with 6000 mAh which easily lasts two days with lite use. I gamed on it for an hour and the battery only drops by 10%, After a whole day it drops by 30% (depends on your usage). 5) Build quality:- The build quality of the phone is poor but at this price range you have to comprise. The Back panel and fingerprint sensor is made out of thin plastic. 6) Front camera:- The front camera is not par with what we get at this price range but it clicks good photos but still after zooming the quality degrades. 7) Software optimization :- this phone is new and the software optimization will take time but it already has got an update for bugs, camera and software which made the phone smoother but more work can be done . 8) Last but not the least; One UI:- Other phone boast about their internal and hardware but the One UI stand on top of all. I personally like this UI which has tons of features but also maintains its simplicity. It has everything you need with gestures and features like dark mode and It also gives you the feel and comfort which brings the experience to a whole new level. Everything is adjusted so that you could use this phone in one hand everything in the settings could be reached by your thumb. Everything in the UI is well organized and most of the features are here as this is the same UI used in Samsung flagship phones. Conclusion:- You could buy this phone if you need performance, battery, display and a good user interface. But don't think of using this phone outside without case or tempered glass, still if you don't it also has free screen replacement for one year but I would be careful as at this price range you get a pretty decent phone."

I bought this phone due to 3 reasons 1) One UI 2) Display sAMOLED 3) good processor (good but not the best) 4) Good RAM management Cons 1) Polycarbonate build. (Use good case) 2) No infrared 3) No the best smartphone for hardcore gaming, there is redmi 5 pro which is better for gaming. 4) Just one issues is with switch application, it shows a little lag when you move betwwen application. But once app is switched there is no delay what so ever. Overall good product. Best smartphone in affordable category. I would highly recommend anyone to buy it."

133141,mobile,"Here is my review after getting M30s The design surprise me, I thought its gonna be bulky but looks premium. Set up all the apps and update as well 1. Super amoled full hd is the best display under 2. One UI is top notch 3. Battery is good enought, but expect more from 6000mAh 4. Performance meets expectations 5. Rear camera is good, but not monster 6. Phone automatically heats up while I was sleeping and drains 20 % battery, Dear #SAMSUNG please fix this. Photo attached is Night mode shot."
170567,mobile accessories,with a new series I thought that samsung will increase there quality. But still samsung smartphones are same as old smartphones. My samsung M20 start hanging just after inserting sim cards. it hangs every time in normal uses like after watching youtube the disply does not respond even after having 4GB of RAM. So advice to everybody don't purchase.
134982,mobile,I had a little doubt about the sound quality but the Dolby Atmos feature is just amazing and camera performance is also very nice. Apart from that the phone is not heavy just like OP7 pro. I am glad I this made this purchase after messing up with a huge confusion.
133387,mobile,Honestly speaking... It's a great device. Camera is one of the main highlight of this device. And the wrap charge 30T is extremely fast. It charge the phone in an hour. But there is only one issue that I am facing is raise to wake and tap to wake is working properly in my device. Means sometimes it's working and sometimes it's not. The issue for this is I've press the power button then only I am able to unlock the screen. I hope this issue will get resolved in near future.

Battery is superb with medium use it can run 8-10 hours easy with medium saving and with light use it can run more then 2 days and above with single charge(note: please option out fast charging from setting it may heat your phone, normal charging is fast enough. 2. Camera is really good,(Note: during video recording don't forget to adjust brightness or the video contrast is low) 3. Better app security, (you can find seperate setting for allowing or disallowing apps to use you personal details like contacts, location & messages or background data usage. 4. Multiwindow view. 5. it can run full HD videos and also on youtube. 6. Inbuild Antivirus & Device optimizer, no need to install thrid party apps, less download unknown third party apps more your phone becomes secure other then essential apps. Cons: Fingerprint sensor and face unlock sensor is not very fast. Overall the phone is very optimised for better performance and battery life, it has all inbuild security apps. This samsung model won't disappoint you, don't go with misleading youtube reviews."

123764,mobile accessories,Finger Print sensor is quiet good but it sometimes takes time to read fingerprint. But within this price range Samsung has given a good quality fingerprint sensor. Camera quality it good but there is some issue with details that it miss in photo which it should have given with 13+5 MP camera. Also boke mode is missing. Need a little more work on camera to beat other competitors which I think samsung can easily do in future. Rest the camera it quiet good as compared to the phones of this range. Battery life of 4000mAh is more than what is expected from samsung . Well done Samsung team. Keep up the good work . Will always support you.

163298,mobile,"Very good phone, I am loving the display and specially the 90hz display gives a buttery smooth experience. Watching videos in this phone takes it to a different level. The camera is also very good, however the night mode does not produce good pics rather it looks very artificial. But in proper daylight and good amount of lights even in indoor conditions gives real good pictures. Battery is ok, gives me a full day with 30-40 leftover charge but definitely could have been better."

Battery backup is not that great, otherwise you get everything you expect from a mid ranger Camera, Speed, Sound, Connectivity. One downside is absence of 3.5mm jack so while on charging you have to use Bluetooth speakers. But anyway this is the future. My next upgrade will surely be Mi A3. I am a fan of Stock Android."
134880,smartTv,I got the 7 at lowest price. Its been 3 months now and Iam more than happy with the product i bought from Amazon. I would like to thank Amazon India for their incredible product services. About the phone: Design- As always the niche product that apple holds. Camera- Impressive clearer dimensions with 7 MP selfie add to the curve. Memory- For non gamers its the hit. OS- Very fast and smooth running. Rating- 9.5 out of 10

He wanted a more powerful one with 6 Gb and 128 gb which was also reduced in price. So, I had to order again. Price wise its good. Have to use it and see the durability. Camera quality is awesome, red comes out more. Helps in case you have color blindness to see red LOL."

135093,mobile,"I have always been a bit skeptical towards Samsung products, but the specs and the pricing of this phone made me try it, and to my surprise, the phone has not disappointed (yet). The camera is amazing, food mode, AR emoji, night mode, everything. My most favourite feature of this phone though would be it's humongous battery, I went through an entire day of continuous camera use, Bluetooth earphones and watch and half day using WiFi for 1080p videos, and the battery barely passed the halfway mark by the end of the day. So far, not bad."
121088,smartTv,"Dont buy this product. Product is not worth it. I had read all the reviews saying Apple is apple and it never crashes/hangs and bought it. I have seen it crash, hang and heating. Battery life is good. It's worth buying some other make products which would give better performance and value for your hard earned money, with the equivalent amount. If you haven't earned your money then definitely to just showoff you can buy this. Pros: Good battery, will work for the day. Cons: Not for performance user, heats and hangs sometimes. Software compatibility will be issue with the latest OS Mojave."
170418,mobile,"very happy with the product, as described each and every feature is authentic, moreover, the camera is absolutely amazing, it captures the total view and that to with amazing clarity. the battery life is indeed very long the screen display is wonderfully colourful and colour rich you feel a sense of pride keeping this phone in your hand as it gives you a special look as if you're holding something unique. The face recognition feature is also very accurate in recognizing your face. The touch is also very good. To think that I bought J7 Pro with 3GB 64 GB configuration at 18000 plus , Galaxy M30S 6gb 128 gb is truly a great value for money"
130662,smartTv,Good purchase. Fulfills all it claims.

132759,mobile accessories,Had opted for an exchange offer of the old phone. My parents who are both senior citizens were at home when the delivery boy came with the new phone. His behaviour was extremly rude. He insisted for the box and charger of the old phone to be given with the old phone and was not willing to handover the new phone to my parents. My parents were extremly terrified and gave the box and charger of the old phone in fear. This is really un-acceptable.

I requested Amazon to return this phone and would like to go with different phone. My expectation was different with this phone. Amazon didn‚Äôt return it they just replaced it and I am not satisfied with this purchase. Amazon did to me when I am a almost 7 years old customer of Amazon. I told that I don‚Äôt want money, keep it in my account and I would like to go with different phone as this phone is not as I was expected. Amazon customer executive didn‚Äôt find a way to help , instead of that they just said this is what we can do only replace with same phone. Still camera is not doing ... fingerprint is slow .. phone is slow ... but I am not going to complain again becoz they may check found the issue they will just replace which doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Request to buyers ... please read the policy carefully when you bye anything from Amazon. I am customer of Amazon from US and was having the same mind set that if you didn‚Äôt like thing you can return and get the right one which you like, but this is not same in India. So be careful we may need to check physically in store before buying it online ... as you may stick with these policies and stuck with the things which you don‚Äôt like."

153632,mobile,Samsung Galaxy M30 series is surely a cut above. It's like getting gold in silver's price. It's working good till date and hope so it lasts. The fingerprint reader was a little problematic in the beginning but soon we got used to it or rather it got used to us. The camera quality is a cut above in this price range. The true bang for the buck is in the battery life of the phone. The fast charging combined with the long lasting battery makes it good as a traveling accompaniment.

124258,smartTv,"First, I was very much skeptical to order an iPhone over the internet, be is amazon or flipkart, I still feel its the luck factor when you still get your costly devices in hand one piece as they should be; given the terrified instances we have seen with many retailers. I understand there's little control over these things, even from amazon's perspective (which they are doing a splendid job), I feel the onus completely lies on the retailer. Alright, so the core part of this...... Amazing, superb, splendid, awesome, classic...I feel short on adjectives to define this masterpiece...Apple,,,I have started to fall in love with Apple devices. I have resisted them over the years, but now I realize I have 3 of them....you can choose to ignore but can't resist. A simple, yet powerful device, makes your life hell lot easy...powered packed components. One thing which I admire about this is that they dont need jazzy advertisements or fake ratings to promote apple devices, they are build the way you wouldn't hate them. Although the ram seems to be less, the memory management is so efficient that you dont have to bother on clearing the cache (unlike android). Display is superb, crystal clear...just make sure you get a tempered glass, and it adds an additional beauty to this. i still wonder when you made such an excellent device, why cant apple build the glass that way. So far I feel 32 GB is enough although I have started taking more pictures...you'll feel the need to do it given the camera quality. They should have given an option for potrait mode (with some additional price ofcourse). This is for someone who dont want a large screen but needs a dual camera and potrait mode. Still I am pretty much happy with the picture quality and the composition. I like the touch button and the level of customization available. overall, not regretting the decision at all...happy about it....I think I made the right choice."

136449,smartTv,"I ordered this phone for my father. Initially I was doubtful about it's screen performance bcz it has 720p resolution but I was completely surprised when I received the phone. Clarity and Colour reproduction on the screen are very good even though it has lower resolution (720x1520 pixels). Rear Camera is average (but not bad) but Selfie Camera is awesome. If u like to capture selfies and want a phone under 8000 ‚Çπ then this phone is definitely made for u. This phone also has a dedicated memory card slot, so u don't have to worry about space. Screen consumes less power bcz of lower resolution that's why 4000 mah battery performs really well."

132863,refrigerator,"Happy to see that MI is providing such an awesome product for such a low price while comparing with other brands. It comfortable light weight itz much more than a normal watch and a fitness band. Everone will notice it due to the irresistible look. Now comming to the product in terms of fuctions, it get everything in my opinion. It has in-comming call alert and msg alert. Also displays phone message as well as WhatsApp message which is in English. Emojis are not supported. It have a strong vibration but itz not annoying. The call alert feature is more useful while riding bikes. Also its water proof which means u can carry it anywhere. Display is bright and crisp and can be readable also it have a night mode for low brightness. Battery life is also good, lasted for a week on a full charge. One con i found is that in direct sunlight the display is not that much brighter. Otherwise itz an awesome product to have. Again thank you Amazon for great shopping experience and for 2 day delivery."

161349,mobile,Under this price I got the best phone but it's 3010 mAh battery is a little problem but this is Android one device so the battery backup is not very good but good and I love the product very much thank you #MI and #Amazon.
113172,mobile,"As the headline states, for normal users like me who use the phone for official mails, reading online news, WhatsApp and a little bit of music on a daily basis this is a fantastic phone for the price for which it is being offered. I bought it for ‚Çπ5500 during the Prime day sale after exchanging my old phone for ‚Çπ4000 (got ‚Çπ1000 extra on exchange and 10% cash back). That's an awesome deal for me. About the phone: Battery: If i start my day with full charge I end up with 40% when i go to sleep. My usage is normal and use the phone to check whatsapp, music, read news or automotive blogs and 30 mins of phone calls. Using the standard charger the battery charges roughly at the rate of 1% per minute. Fast chargers can charge quicker. Stock Android: after using REDMI MIUI for 3 years I wasn't sure how it would be to use stock Android. However, after using the phone for nearly a month now i am loving it. The phone runs on Android Pie now and is expected to recieve Android Q when its released. Storage: 64GB is more than enough for me. Being an Android One phone you can store your data on Google Drive for free. At the moment i am only using 35% storage. 3.5 mm AUX jack: the phone doesn't have a 3.5 mm headphone jack but it comes with an 3.5 mm adapter which can be used to use the headphones. The downside is you need keep it with you wherever you go. I have kept it in office as thats the only place I use headphones. Performance: The phone performs well for normal usage and haven't faced heating issues. Tried a couple of games and they works smoothly. Camera: my old phone is a REDMI and my wife uses a REDMI Note 7. But the camera in MI A2 is far better than then and most other budget phones. The pictures are crisp and has lesser noise. This, as many had already had reviewed is a strong feature in the phone. Smart Reply: the AI based Smart SMS reply work so well that it gives right suggestion. As we have seating limitations in office one of me team members sent an SMS asking me, ""do we have seats on the 6th floor?"" the automatic reply options were ""i guess so"", ""yes"" and ""no"". The response options keep changing to the sms and it's very apt. Look and feel: i bought a blue phone and the colour is good. But i didn't like the white border around the screen which i felt ugly. But the black and the red colour phones do not have it and look lot better. The metal body is a bit slippery and the protruding camera bump is huge. You definitely need a case to protect it. What i have done is buy Solimo tempered glass which has black borders. It is perfect fit and hides the white border. For additional protection I bought the Case U cover which nicely protects the phone and the protruding camera lens. Other Features: Face unlock works well when there is light but not when its dark. Fingerprint reader is placed well and works fast. The phone is slim and light. Even with the tempered glass and cover it is slimmers than many other phones and is nice to hold. There are no unwanted ads that keep coming in other phones which is great."
157183,smartTv,The best phone I have ever used till date Love the performance everything about iPhone is just so amazing
124385,mobile,For normal users battery is sufficient because it is well optimized by the Google official ROM.

It cant recognize on dim light but it can fastly recognize in day light and front clear view..Camera is very natural no color enhancement so I was beaten when I compared photos taken with my friends phone even its 48 mp, but first natural photographer will praise it for photo detail in it. Game performance is unbelievable unbeatable.. my friends look with jawdropping experience. Fast performance even opening so much apps downloading at a time . Happy to have this phone.

154564,mobile,So far the best phone I used till date. With my use I charged my previous phone twice a day but with this one I need charging once in 2 days. Pros: 1. Display as in specification most vivid and lucid 2. Touch works like charm 3. 6GB +128GB what more can you ask for 4. Camera works great 5. Lightweight 6. 6000mAh battery Cons: 1. Little big for one hand use Otherwise best in class smartphone from Samsung.

Another key advantage is that even though it carries a monster battery, it feels light weight similar to a 5000 mah phone.I dont know how samsung did it.

118487,smartTv,"Bought this product for‚Çπ64,000. Using this laptop for over a month. Insane performance.I am a coder and developer,and I think this is a good laptop for me. It can also handle almost all the games with decent quality and almost no frame drops. Pros: 1) Keyboard- the keyboard is nice to handle.Do have backlit(Comes pretty handy during night&light outs).One of the best keyboard I have ever used.(Definitely better than hp laptops in this price range) 2) Trackpad- Best among the non-mac laptops. The touch is very responsive and pretty smooth. 3)Charges up pretty quickly (0 to 60 in 35-40 min). 4) 4)The cooling system is great.You can adjust the fan speed with keyboard. 5)Due to SSD the boot time is insane(less than 15 sec).SSD let's apps to open at a much faster rate. 6)Sound quality is awesome.The speakers are placed on both left and right side and can get pretty loud. 7)Great connectivity (wired and wireless). 8)NVDIA GEFORCE GTX1050,INTEL i5 8300H processor. 9)Sexy design. Cons: 1) Sometimes I can feel (for a moment) that the trackpad is lagging.Its only for a second or two but I felt it. 2)With so much to get you won't be getting a great camera.Though the camera is decent in normal lighting conditions,it performs poorly in low light. 3) BATTERY- #While watching videos offline 3.5-4hrs. #While typing/coding 4-5hrs easily. #Watching movies online 3-3.5hrs. #Games 1.5-2hrs(I would recommend play with charger plugged in). #Normal usage 3-4hrs. 4)No card slot.(Didn't had a need till now). Heard about display being of low quality.I personally never felt it."

Pros: 1. Excellent battery life.. 2. Excellent Display (Samsung has one of the best) 3. Camera quality is good (depends on expectation) 4.Night mode across several system apps like ph keypad, msg, default browser etc.. 5. Premium looks (although plastic body) Cons: 1.Face recognition little slow compared to even Realme 1. 2. For sharing camera pics to whts app realme UI is better.. Hope it will be helpful for taking ur decision.."

137985,smartTv,Initially I was little skeptical to buy this TV as I hadn't heard before. But I wanted to give it a shot based on reviews and I would say I am not disappointed. Picture quality is outstanding. Sound volume is more than Samsung or LG tv. Smart feature is crisp. Overall it's a pretty good package. My next TV would be from Kevin 65 inch. All my friends and family were also surprised to see this TV performance. I am pretty sure they will buy this too soon.
119851,refrigerator,"Check reviews on youtube, delivery from amazon was great along with safty packagint. D5600 70-300mm lens is not the best , it blurs out images when zoomed in to its full"
142815,mobile,"MiA2 is the successor to the popular A1. The phone comes with stock Android and fantastic cameras both at the front and at the back. Display is very good. Sound quality is good. Response is fluid thanks to Android One. No lag whatsoever. Battery life is decent and will last you for more than a day - I charge my phone every morning at my desk Camera is the best feature of the phone. Both front and back caneras are really good and offer great quality. I found two disadvantages with the phone: 1. Proximity sensor issue - most people attribute it to a software bug. Forums are full of solutions that may or may not work for you. At some point the phone was unusable for me and I was thinking of selling it away. A software suggested on Mi forum solved my issue, so am continuing to use it. This may be a deal-breaker for many, since there is no permanent solution in sight in the near future. 2. Camera bump- The protruding camera bump requires you to have a good case. Without proper case, camera lens are prone to scratch and may destroy the USP of this phone. Invest in a good case immediately when you get the phone. Battery life has been reported to be poor by many. I found it to be good enough for regular use. if you are a heavy gamer,this may be a downer for you. Buy a 128gigs version when possible, since there's no SD card facility for dual sim users. Overall a great phone in its price segment. I hope there's a permanent solution to the Proximity sensor issue soon. Cheers ‚úåÔ∏è"

I contacted nearest service center but they didn't accepted the warranty since there is a big scratch over the powerbank. I asked several what's the matter with scratch which is on the body,the powerbank has stopped working so there must me circuit related issues.

137797,mobile accessories,In display Fingerprint sensor is very poor.. It is very slow and usually does not detect the finger in first chance.. Overall phone performance is good.. I wanted a stock android phone so I bought Mi A3.. Rest of the things are the best in the class.. 1. Rear Camera- Decent 2. Front Camera- Excellent 3. Battery - Excellent 4. Performance/Processor- Decent 5. Display- Decent 6- Fingerprint sensor- Very Poor

138830,mobile,"It is very early to comment, the first experience with the phone is awesome. However, I am quite disappointed with the camera, though even using triple camera the quality not at par, it produces grains in low light as well as the effect of selfie-cam and main camera is not very effective. There are other phone which is providing good results, even in the lesser camera configuration. Though, I trust Vivo as a brand is good would really ensure to upgrade the software and application of the camera in the next software upgrade. So guys if anyone buying this phone for camera, please think about it again."

112484,smartTv,Amazing product for the cost.
160491,mobile,"This product Mi A2 by Xiaomi is just too good, it's worth every penny you'll pay. People will be complaining about it's battery life, but every smartphone in the market be it be a flagship or a budget smartphone, requires charge by the end of the day. So, that being said, let me tell you the pros and cons. The camera is that equivalent to google pixel 2, no , really it is. And Android One platform makes it super easy for you to modify the existing default camera of this phone into that comparable to most of the flagship phones offered by tech giants in the mobile industry. Video recording is superb and no other phone in this price range or even above can come close to the quality and it never lags. Now I've seen people on YouTube and various forums talking about the gaming experience not that good and Honor play being better than this, we'll let me clear off the dust from their eyes, talking about gaming, the graphics and smoothness of this phone while playing is top notch, other phones just can't come near it at all. Don't trust me, be my guest and try it for yourself. These, so called reviews about the phone you see online is mostly faulty, they never made the effort to fully understand this device. It's extremely powerful and overall performance it mind boggling. Now again talking about the battery, well it's true that it's only 3010mah battery, but is quite efficient in every way, if you know how to keep all the nonsense background apps off except the important once, this phone will surprise you regarding it's runtime. People comparing this phone to Honor play or vivo v9pro are just looking at the bigger battery of those phones, not understanding that this phone is beautiful, Powerful and compact at the same time, gives better camera,gaming performance and experience and it's Android One, so no problem at all. Plus battery charges fastest in this phone as it's 3010mah, which if you are being practical, is more than enough to do most of the task along with gaming and what not in an entire day. Well, if you are one of those people who are always in their phone and the phone is their world, than you can go for bigger battery, but it just won't do you any good in any wayand you'll miss out on the experience provided by this device. The only con according to me is the brightness, now with the latest Android 9 pie update, it's even worse, to get a decent brightness, you'll need to increase it upto atleast 25-33%, before the update, I was able to get the same brightness at 5-10% brightness, now that's just weird, as I am a person who manages the phone as well as possible to get the maximum out of it and this brightness thing is just messing up with my battery, if we use 30-50% on brightness whole playing games and using other heavy apps, the battery is gonna drain even faster, I hope the Mi A2 team fixes it in the upcoming updates or so. But that's the only con I could find so far in this phone, rest assured this phone is Kickass, will give you all the power and experience you're looking for and if you're confused to whether buy it, just don't be hesitant, go ahead, buy it. It's the best in it's price range and excells better than flagship phones in some department. Don't miss out on this!!"
121043,smartTv,"Don't think about it very much, it is a superb great and lots more product. Im really really satisfied after buying this speaker. Awesome sound quality. I also ordered 2nd one for my brother . I buy this at rs 1700 , which is the cheapest I think. GRAB IT."
168201,refrigerator,good one
160464,mobile,This power bank is totally worth the money.
138825,mobile,It is very bad to know that the camera quality is not at all good even with 48 Mpa. Now I'm feeling waste of money. I thought Samsung brand is reliable but I feel they are fooling the customer. I have ordered redmi note 7pro at the same time but cancelled later thinking that Samsung will be a brand one and reliable. If I have the option to refund me I will opt for it immediately.
145609,mobile accessories,Nice phone in this price range. Camera not good in low light. Fingerprint sensor and face unlock is very quick. Battery life is very good. Lasts for 1.5 day. Fast charging is also very good. Phone charges abt 60% in half an hour. The best phone in matter of looks. Phantom blue looks awsum. Moreover its a very good phn for handling and light weight as compared to other phones. The looks are premium.

158079,mobile,The phone is good.
152333,mobile,"Pros Amazing battery life even with heavy usage i end the day with almost 45% remaining. The display is flagship grade and provides great colour and movie watching experience. Slim bezels and One UI is just fast and snappy. This phone handles heavy games really well, PUBG runs at smooth+extreme or hdr=high framerate. Rear camera captures good photos (you can use gcam for even better results) wide angle is really useful. Dolby atmos for great movie watching experience. Cons A not so great selfie camera Battery takes almost 2 hrs to charge fully but its reasonable for a phone with 6000mah"
111341,mobile accessories,After four month during the call phone will heat up and then phone start smoke then I throw the phone and phone battery busted if I late little bit I will harm myself with this bad quality phone.

But this mobile changed my mind. - Camera is good (low light photography is below average) 3.5/5 - Battery Champ (After a heavy use for the day still not craving for charging) 4.5/5 - Just after purchasing got android pie and One UI (very user friendly and intuitive) 4.5/5 - Good RAM management (No performance lag faced till now) 4/5 - Cool dude (No heating problem faced despite of playing games and heavy usage of social media) 4/5 - Overall verdicts 4/5 Should buy if you are planning.

134220,smartTv,I bought the Fire stick on Prime Day sale...and it's really making life easier by putting all streaming platforms in one place. But the remote stopped working not even a week later. And now we are having to operate it with the Fire stick TV app on phone. It's really disappointing to see the remote just stop working within a few days of buying the product. Hope we can get a new remote as replacement or Amazon helps us out with the repair.

138052,smartTv,"Installed the unit ,myself, as a Tabletop. After adjustment of picture brightness, contrast, sharpness, saturation etc. to my liking, picture appeared to be 5/5. Sound quality is 3/5 fidelity wise ( clear but lacking Bass sound .. didn't expect also at this price) and 5/5 loudness wise,( in consideration of price of this product) .. Media features like Netflix, YouTube, gmail working are perfect. However one need to remain careful while downloading attachments from gmail, in view of limited Internal storage of 8 GB of which only 3.5 GB is free initially. No comments possible on durability or Mcast feature, as the product has been received and installed just today. Overall grading , as a Smart TV at its price range , should be 4.5/5"
124203,smartTv,First of fall many many thanks for today's delivery........ & ph is toooooooo good tnks a lot Amazon.
134076,mobile,"I believe firmly that this is the Best Affordable Phone Apple has ever made!!! 1. Superb Build 2. Amazing Screen, Excellent Sunlight visibility, Great contrast and watching content on this screen or Reading is just an absolute pleasure!!! 3. A12 Bionic chip is flawless!! day-to-day usage, Gaming, Multi tasking all works great. 4. Being a singer, as I record songs in Karoke apps like Smule and Starmaker, recording I made thru iPhone were the best so far in the huge list of phones I used, eversince I started singing. In-Box headphones are wonderful and the Mic just works amazing. (Interested to check my recordings, please check with the ID : vindurocks, same ID for both Smule and Starmaker). 5. The highlighting factor about this phone is the Battery Life. The A12 Bionic chip is such power efficient that it my phone still has atleast 40% battery left whern I reach home after work!! and thats incredible looking at the battery capacity that apple furnished in the phone. (I have my Data connection always ON, bluetooth ON and connected to Airpods, and when in Office, always connected to WI-Fi) 6. Camera is Good too on this.. though not the best camera apple made, but it gets the job done for me. So no complaints on that as well!! 7. Buttons are super tactile and clicky.. Ear piece is clear. Signal reception is Good as well. So its actually works well as a phone apart from all other shenanigans I mentioned earlier. So Full Marks Apple :) 8. The face unlock is blazing fast and its more secure than most of the android phones out there. So no complaints for not furnishing a fingerprint reader. (after the upgrade to iOS 13.2, face unlock became much more efficient. So great job done. On a whole, even if you are a power user, this phone will suffice with all the aspects you are expecting out of a smart phone. And my sincere advise to other who are out there is, if you already own this phonne, then don't go for iphone 11.. instead, use it for 2 years and go for iPhone 12, as we are expecting some breakthrough features with the same. So this is my opinion and Kudous to apple for making this attempt in making this iPhone a Great Value For Money device."

It can play FM. And can take calls also. There is a recieve button in it. We can talk trough it when connected with phone. But the built in microphone is not that good. It takes a lot of noises.

158207,mobile accessories,"The phone performance is good under 15k category smartphone. Feature given by the product are good. Fingerprint sensor, face unlock feature works very effectively taking no time to unlock the device. The camerea quality is good but sometimes the pitcure captured becomes blured.The speed of phone is fast under 3gb ram phones. The charging of device is also as per the company promise of fast charge. But one of the draw back is the device is heated if used for long amount of period continusoly and during gaming too. The weight of the device is comparatively heavier then other device of these segment.I recommend these phone for best budget phones."
145045,mobile accessories,Nice mobile
116149,mobile,Battery retain very quickly and fingerprint not responding sometimes it takes time to unlock phone and camera pixels are not matching which are mentioned.

158520,smartTv,The product is quite good under my budget but the sound quality is not as what i have expected. Battery life is on and around 3 and half hour to 4 hour under constantly use of internet. seems to be good product and under the budget. most important to make a note on this product is that this doesn't have cd-dvd rom drive.. overall it's a good deal
135530,smartTv,"I have used this laptop for three weeks now. The screen is good, the performance is fabulous. It gives about 100-150 MB/s transfer speed from my external hard disk. Windows boots in around 5 seconds. The keyboard is joy to type on. The backlight with two brightness options is cool. I keep finding excuses to type anything on the keyboard. It's that good. The trackpad is awesome. the screen seemed a bit yellow out of the box to me but not to anyone else. People didn't believe me when I told them that this is a gaming laptop. Which is exactly what I was going for. It has an understated look unlike other gaming laptops. The battery life was bad at first but then I enabled the 'hybrid mode' in the in-built lenovo vantage software and it gives me around 5 hours of battery life which is fine with me. Haven't tried many games but CS:GO, Pubg Lite and Pubg Mobile Emulator runs smoothness. Fans noise has never been audible in the time I've used this laptop. Never been hot to the touch around the keyboard area. The laptop and the charger are a bit heavier, but this is a gaming laptop so no complains. I haven't used the webcam for video calling yet but it seems good. The warranty I got is not exactly 360 days but more like 300 days only. That's the only fault I could find in this laptop. It's my first personal laptop and I can't realistically ask anything more from it at this price."

This review will getting little longer but after reading you will knowü§î everything about this! 1.Looks and Build:Trust me guys under 6k this is the best design no smartphone offering you this type of design yes its build is made of plastic but under 6k you cannot expect better than this. Even its plastic then also its feel solid yes it can take scratches easily so I will recommend you to buy a back cover for your smartphone. *Even mid range phone get scratches so easily*ü§£ 2.Camera: now camera is the thing which many people likes and dislikes but in my opinion under 6k this camera is best talking about the front camera it is even impressiveüòÆ the qualities actually true 5 megapixel.üòé And the rear camera according to price its decent not so good but not so bad it's actually work fine with this budget category phone.üòâ According to me you cannot expect more than this in this price.üëç 3.Batteryüîã: in today's smartphone battery is the major problem that it's not even last for a day but under the budget of 6k 3000 MaH battery is not bad. Under the moderate usage it can last upto a day.üóìÔ∏è Battery is pretty decent. Performance‚úåÔ∏è: this phone is powered by MediaTek helio a22 quad core processor which is clocked at speed of 2.0 gigahertz. And according to this price range this processor is good for this phone it can easily handle your daily work like social networking ,playing games medium graphic one, all other small works. you need to kept in mind that this phone price only 6,000 rupees so you cannot expect more than this. Now some people will say that 2GB RAM and 16GB storage is low and we cannot use this phone smoothly. But in my opinion if you want this phone for light use then this will not create problem for you. But for heavy users who wishes to play pubg on it That's not for you guys! ‚ò∫Ô∏è But you know the fun fact you can play pubg on low graphic setting on this device!üòÜ And also if you are that type of person who downloading apps and apps multiple apps on your smartphone Daily then this device is not for you. Displayüì≤: under this price range this display is best nothing to say anything more (Important):- I read many reviews on Amazon and people are saying that the smartphone is bad its sound quality is not good, its battery backup is not good, its build quality is not good. According to me they want more in this price range but in my opinion you cannot get this much in 6k! In last let's take my verdict: If you want phone for lite use Not for heavy purpose then this phone is made for you. But in any case if you want a little better smartphone then this you can pay 1500 rupees extra and grab the realme c1. Real me C1 is also good value for money option for you yes you can play pubg on it."

133415,mobile,"Honor Band 5 is simply amazing. This is my second fitness band. Earlier I had MI band. Presently, there is an intense comparison between MI 4 and Honor Band 5 everywhere. Biggest problem with MI band is that you have to take the device out from the band for charging. After five to six month, the strap becomes loose and device falls. This is what happened with me. I am really surprised that no reviewers have ever pointed out on it. 1 Accuracy: Earlier I had MI band, it is used to count steps while driving too. Honor doesn‚Äôt count steps while driving. 2 Sleep reading is just perfect in Honor band. It gives you detailed information about your pattern of sleep. 3 The Huawei Health is very user friendly, it gives you complete information about your workout. If you are looking for a reliable, practical and durable fitness band then go for Honor Band 5."

117242,mobile accessories,"Best midranger budget camera king phone , plus android one with no bloatware ,good battery backup"
159269,smartTv,"This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags! Now, off to the device. Pros The device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal. Speakers sound better than my previous phone. A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe! OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work. Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either. Cons Remember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced. Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them. No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones. Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need."

166002,mobile,"Worst audio, not worth buying"
156976,smartTv,"The TV looks and sounds great, and is a steal at this price point. The display is fantastic, although the colours (blacks in particular) look slightly bleached when compared side by side with a higher end TV. The speakers are phenomenal - sound is clear and loud albeit a little tinny / metallic at higher pitch and not as ""warm"" as external speakers or sound systems. Built-in Chromecast works seamlessly across iOS and Android devices though I suspect upscaling is limited to 1080p. The TV has a great selection of ports both on the back and the side, and thankfully most of the legacy ports have been placed at the back unlike some of the bizarre port placement options seen on competing TVs in this price range. The display is nearly edge to edge, the TV produces no noticeable heat, doesn't seem to attract too much dust or fingerprints. The processor is fast and responsive and I am yet to identify any noticeable lag in playing content. There are some issues with OTT content though. When installing Netflix, you are warned that the app isn't optimized for the TV. The warning turns relevant when trying to play HDR10 content on Netflix: half the time, only the audio plays and the other half of the time, the video lags behind the audio. I've got around this by using Netflix through my PS4 Pro, which for some reason limits 4K content to 4K YUV420 (the RGB option is greyed out). For the same reason, 4K gaming on the TV (Fifa 19, Last of Us Remastered) isn't as satisfying on the TV as it could have been. I'm not sure if other reviewers have experienced this, but I've faced this issue with several Netflix shows. I suspect some of these shows are optimized for Dolby Vision, which is not supported by the TV, hence causing issues. Prime Video is not compatible with the TV and is missing from the Play Store, so will need to be sideloaded, and neither Jio TV nor Jio Cinema can be cast (although you can work around these using screen mirroring on an Android smart phone). Hotstar works fine, as does YouTube. Minor annoyances - the TV takes a little bit of time to start up but has an ""instant power on"" mode which puts the TV to sleep instead of turning it off, which improves start up time drastically. Wi-fi connectivity takes a little bit of time when starting up the TV. Backlight is set to 100 by default and needs to be changed manually, and each of the preset picture modes are, without exception, terrible (on ""sport"" mode, grass looks so bright its nearly unwatchable). The menu and input buttons on the voice remote are somewhat iffy, although the voice button (aka Google Assistant button) itself works fabulously well. Bottom line - the TV is a great purchase (both visually and aurally) but as a standalone device intended solely for playing online streaming content, it may not be the best. I will likely get a Firestick 4K (currently available for pre-order) to use as a my primary device for online content, or alternatively, continue to use my PS4 as I am doing currently. In the ideal world, it may be better to buy a cheap ""dumb"" 4K TV and combine that with a 4K streaming device, but since no such TV exists, we are constrained to try our luck with smart TVs, and this one works better than most :)"

Overall must buy device
120759,mobile accessories,Display quality so low
154508,mobile,"So after using 3 days I am writing this review. Display 5/5 Because with the super amoled display it looks so stunning. You will find it so colourful when you stream a 720p or 1080p video. Battery 5/5 Only one word needed to describe the battery of this phone and that is 6000mah. If you are a light user, the battery will go upto 2-3 days. If you are a heavy user, playing games for a long time,watching movies for 3 hours,still it will go for 1.5-2 days. So good battery back-up. Camera 4.5/5 Okay now this is not a very normal camera that we can use very easily. You have to have little knowledge about photography before usng the camera. Then you can use it at pro level. For those who know photography well,they can click stunning pictures. 48 mp with extra depth and live focus is absolutely amazing. Talking about the selfie camera,16 mp is little over. It gives you a decent picture,a good quality picture but it doesn't look like 16 mp. Also to add, wide angle camera is one of the good feature that you have. Gaming 4.5/5 I have played pubg and COD in this mobile. The only problem is if you play for long 2-3 hours,it will be little heated. The back panel near the rear camera will be heated. But while gaming there will be no lag issues,minor frame drop and decent battery. Game booster helps you uninterrupted gaming facility. Fingerprint sensor is really fast, face unlock is also good. I hope you find this helpful."

This JBL's had mic and good build and comparable sound quality. I bought it for 630rs which is also less when we see what it offers. Finally good one."
139092,smartTv,It was not supported most of the normal APK app. But it is a good LED TV. It was enough for basic TV users. If you expect more with Android TV I never suggest. Picture & Sound qualities are excellent.

In the past I accidentally hit my 8 years old Sony LCD and another 1 year old Sony LED but nothing happened so what is so different in this Kavin TV. of course the thin and cheap LCD panel to save the cost. And new LED panel is costing 80% of the value of the TV. Funny :) I am sure now that I will never buy non-branded electronic items."

143557,mobile,"My two primary drivers before this was the Poco f1 and the Nokia 7plus. So my comparision will primarily be with these two. Performance: One word - snappy ! Display: Gorgeous. 90hz refresh rate is clearly noticeable. Battery: Now this is the most criticised aspect of the phone , well let me tell u it is NOT Bad at all ! Believe it or not I got 5+ hrs screen on time with 38% remaining , yes u read that right ! Can't believe it ?! Lol i have screenshot of the battery usage , see it for yourself. So technically I could have easily churned out 8hrs or more screen on time if i had used it till 5% battery. What is confusing is almost every reviewer on YouTube or even user reviews have quoted a maximum of 5.5 hrs SOT at max. Now let me share some tips which i feel might helped in my case , when i first setup my phone i was to migrate my data n apps from old phone. But i did not copy the nearly 100apps i had in my nokia 7 plus , instead i just copied the contacts and messages n synced other settings with Google account. I then clean installed all the apps that i use on a regular basis i.e some 20 odd apps. I am not sure but i feel this could have helped in improving the battery life. I always keep my location off n 4g data always on + wifi when available. Camera: Now most people compare this phone n it's camera with Apple , Google , samsung flagships but fail to understand that those phones cost almost double that of this phone ! The camera takes brilliant pics in good light , low light any lighting condition u throw at it. This camera is a lot good when viewed in isolation n it is only a lil bit inferior when compared side by side with iphone 11 or pixel 3/4 , also u get wide angle camera which is missing on pixel. The camera is more than good enough for social media uploads. Conclusion: Best phone overall n VFM by a mile. If u game a lot then get ROG 2 because that has a bigger battery but as an everyday driver for normal usage this is best !"
156835,mobile,The Best mobile with all the features in one roof. Wide Angle Camera is really superb. Battery 6000Mah is a beast with outstanding backup. Look and feel is really appreciable. Fast Charging is an additional addon for this mobile. Camera is so decent and cool both front and rear. Hope again Samsung will beat its beast with one more featured mobile.
142910,mobile accessories,Mobile designs very nice but camera quality is too bad battery life is too good

157391,refrigerator,The camera is great for beginners who have just stated to learn but the features are slightly complex for understanding. If you have ever used a Nikon camera..I would suggest you buy Nikon because the transition can be little uneasy. But the camera in itself is very good. I have used this camera in limited scenarios but experienced so far is great.
120593,smartTv,Disappointed. Such a bad quality cable that is untested or replaced that it doesn't even go in the USB slot. Cheap quality. I have to use a phone cable.

Till 9th October 2019 (barely 4 months within the purchase) it has stopped functioning 4 times. Every time I've raised a complaint with the LG service centre, they just refill the gas and return the piece saying that it works now even after us raising suspicion that the product is defective. After one month it'll stop working again. We're really unhappy with the product received. Being regular customers of LG and Amazon this is really disheartening. This whole incident is really questioning our brand loyalty. Hope future buyers do not face such an issue."

This is working like breeze, battery life is decent, charging is fast, no bloats, camera is satisfactory at this price range, screen is excellent, touch is super fast, user interface is awesome. I just love every aspect of this phone. However, few of the things I did not like is that I have to download Samsung Max VPN from google and NO INTERNET CONNECTION WITHOUT VPN function is not allowed, few good fonts have been removed like ROSEMARY, COOL JAZZ, and CHOCO COOKY. Good fonts are only downloadable after paying. And some more options may have been given in Themes and Wallpapers. But this can be rectified by samsung by allowing more compatible Themes, Wallpapers, AODs, and Fonts as free in Galaxy Themes App."

Not able to use the phone even to attend a call. Disappointed due to the POOR performance.

Trusted Samsung seeing all positive reviews...plz dont buy samsung mobiles....Total waste of money and time."

134030,mobile,"I am writing this review after 20 days of usage, will update the review after long term usage, while purchasing i was also considering POCO F1 but finally choose to purchase these one , and believe me i dont regreat my decision except camera Here are some pros of this phone 1. Good buid quality : i have opal balck colour and it looks fantastic , but also finger print magnet, its plastic buid and come with gorila glass 3. 2. Light in weight , u dont feel weight of this phone that much as weight distribution is very good as it has that 6000 mah battery. 3. Fantastic battery backup: in my regular usage of 8-10 hours a day, this phone last for almost 2 days. 4. Smooth and feature rich UI : UI is buttry smooth, i didnt had any issue while swapping from one app to other , app were stored in background , ONE UI is so feature rich and customizable, once u will get used to it , u will love it. 5. Display : This was one major reason why i bought this phone , and AMOLED never disappoints , its bright enough to read in direct sunlight, crispier and puchy to produce the differet colours , and i am fan of dark mode in these phone. 6. Physical fingerprints scanner is really fast and i think istead of having indisplay fingerprint scanner , this is really good option to have , plus you can also acces notification panel from this scanner, which surely helps in regular usage. 7. Good gaming performance Cons: 1. Camera : I was expecting much more out of this 48 megapixel camera, but it just turned out to be gimmick, the camera calibration is not done properly and the image processing is also bad, it softeans each and everything, so you dont get any detail in photos, and it becomes more irritating when you capture portrait mode photo. I dont think there are any other major cons in these phone , i hope Samsung improves camera quality by software update . but as a date i think these is the best phone you can buy in these range and these is coming from someone who has used MI phone till now, so this is as par as that phones and surely will hold good in future."

158349,mobile accessories,"The product Samsung M30S is all with the said configuration and presently performing well. No overheating noted during charging. Sufficient Battery that is 6000mAH and fast charging. Display and camera very good. I did not install any app on it so the speed , performance etc .. .later after a month use i will give detail review. I give rating 4.5 for this because samsung did not provide ear phone with the set, which is very much required alongwith the set. I purchased the ear phone separately from outside market. you have to buy protecter glass and mobile coverfrom market which is a additional expenditure to you. Another draw back you can not connect this phone to usb pendrive since samsung changed its universal port to a bigger one (ie. you cannot connect with to OTG cable)."

156849,mobile accessories,The Camera is good. Face ID is better that ever before. Battery is fine too. Though a cover is necessary but makes the phone a lil bulky. The only problem is low light photography is a little grainy because of long exposure. Tripod is necessity for low light.

139041,smartTv,It was a gud deal.
166558,mobile accessories,Worth the money I spent and also additional features like fingerprint and face recognition to unlock amazing and would like to share few negative points like front camera clarity or quality of picture is not like earlier samsung phones. I think you people copied Oppo/ Vivo which is giving very poor quality images. Hope you will address this case and take necessary action in upcoming models. And I'm looking for fingerprint on screen rather than bottom of Mobile. And I have seen many of other manufacturers mobile has SMS organizer feature which Samsung doesn't have in any of the models. I have not got any earphones with mobile which is again bad thing. I may buy outside but I will not feel voice quality and I can not blame earphone or mobile. And now you are sending SMS to win an earphone which is other manufacturers product & giving it to your beloved customers only for 50 numbers. Waiting for ur next model with expected features and earphones.

Little zoom and pictures become very grainy. However post processing done by the phone makes it look smoother. Decent pics . You won't complain. Good vibrant screen. Picture quality is good and colours look good. I believe it is fhd display and it shows."

134738,smartTv,"I found this laptop after a lot of researching. All I have wanted a decent laptop for day to day MS Office work and light in weight for my sister. In terms of specification, it was so cool, but the laptop does not work as per the given specs. The booting time is near 2-3 min, which is super annoying. I am not a computer pro, but how can a Core i3 processor, takes 3 min for booting. After booting it takes another 5 min to work properly. Recently, the battery drainage problem is significant. I don't know what should I do know."
148425,mobile,Ok Budget phone

110151,mobile,1. Battery life is quite good. 2. Sound quality is booming and enough to annoy your room mates. 3. Picture quality in Normal mode is satisfactory however one needs to be good on the portrait mode.
167835,smartTv,first of all when you will buy this you will feel awesome product and it is awesome but the problem you will face is that after six month the sound of the speaker will goes on tearing when you will increase the volume and overall the product is good the Bluetooth strength is awesome beyond expectation and it works like Alexa anytime anywhere. the matte finish on the rubber finish is awesome and will last forever. I am personally using it from 6 month and what experience I feel I have written over here. the battery life is good at last two hour of non stop music playing.
129244,mobile,Good phone in budget no heat issue if we use it moderately quick charge nice looks overall very good features in our budget

121753,mobile accessories,"Everything is good. But camera is very very disappointing. Worts camera. Due to camera quality, the whole impression on the phone is lost. Very noisy and blur photos in artificaial lighting. Seems This camera is not designed in 2019. It looks like very old camera in old and cheap phones. Camera in xiaomi phones are greater than this camera which are available for just 10 to 15 phones. Charging 38k and providing this camera is not at all digestive. I expected flagship range performing camera. I think Honor have cheated and misleaded customers providing the same camera which are used in their budget phones like honor 8x and honor 8c. When photos are clicked in portrait mode.. black photos are outcoming. I recieved an update yesterday and no use of it. Honor should look into it and give an update."
111165,mobile,Actually i ordered a black color power bank bank but somehow i got blue color powerbank and the black is also written on the box but inside there was a blue coloured power bank. Please look up on this matter as soon as possible.

139815,smartTv,It's iPhone
127295,mobile accessories,Good
113098,mobile,As it has snapdragon 660 with memory/RAM of 4/6 GB Variant it determines a great combination with Android One Program as 2 years of OS update and 3 years of Security Patches updates. As company didn't mentioned about storage its like UFS2.1 or previous but its running great with speed of apps opening and PUBG works really great with support of great Soc's in it. But i must recommend go for 6GB and 128 GB variant now a days because it will gonna give you better performance and multitasking with great battery backup. Pros- 1. Camera is great 2. Look is flagship or premium with better heat dissipation 3. Seamless OS updates directly from Google 4. Airtel/Vodafone VOlte works great Cons- 1. Battery would be little better if 4000Mah 2. Camera has optimization bugs otherwise its working great 3. After updating in PIE u will face low sound from speaker issue but it will be resolved by installing VolumeBooster app from Playstore 4. Microphone would be better. At last this mobile is a very good option in 14k budget as it will fulfill all your smartphone requirements in a great way as a daily driver.
167395,refrigerator,beat fitness tracker in this price i am using this band from last 3 months And it‚Äôs quality is excellent and battery life is also awesome in these range of bands
124183,smartTv,First of all this product is gionee mobile not Redimi because I've used this gionee phone before its a gionee phone with redmi logo I think gionee phone having problems selling there product so redimi company buyed for a cheaper price and put there logo plz stop fooling people
168992,smartTv,"laptop looks very premium, performance is very smooth screen quality is also very good but not the best very slim design and amazing battery backup upto 10 to 12 hours. if your are looking for a light weight powerful machine then just go for it ."
134255,refrigerator,"I bought this TV as a backup. The picture quality and sound is good when compared to similar model TV's. Couple occasions I felt slowness in response in switching the apps, but overall it's performed well. I've been using only the apps (Hotstar, Netflix, Prime) on this TV and no issues found. Haven't connected to DTH, so not sure how it performs there."
137643,mobile accessories,If you like bass than buy it superb bass but it's survive in low beats. Overall it's best item and justify price. By the way boat after sales service are damn good. If your earphone having any issue you need only log a complaint on website and upload proof of purchase they send courier person to pickup and they replace your earphone with sealed pack new within 10 days.
132586,mobile accessories,Gud
135148,refrigerator,"I have been using multiple watches to track my run. I bought this since I wanted to understand the foot pod measurement of cadence, impact, stride length etc... But this band is a total disappointment when it comes to running. I am not sure if the band has an issue or the GPS of the app - overall will not recommend this product for anyone. Have attached comparisons of how the watch tracked the workout vs mi band 3 - both the apps were running on the same phone. I also did a comparison with Mi Band 3 - which is the obvious choice thanks to it‚Äôs accuracy (with and without GPS) and addded benefit of Heart Rate. Huawei/Honor - It‚Äôs time you focused on few products and on giving a better experience rather than flooding the market with untested products from mainland."
116501,mobile,Best
142621,mobile,Mast product he bhai log. Le lo saste me mil raha he. This phone have same specifications as x and xs. Only difference is in display
136526,mobile accessories,"I purchased boat rockersz 255 during 2018 and that impressed me the design and sound quality. I brought one more during this 2019 sale for 899 Rs. but there is a big difference in both the products. First of all when it connects it should say ""You are connected to Boat Rockersz 255"" but 2019 sale product skipping "" 255"". looks like it is first copy."
132082,mobile,Great phone at a great price
154555,mobile,So far so good. There is no lag or heating in the phone when you play the heavy game for half an hour. Battery life is also decent and it will surely last for a day for normal use with some gaming activities.
140997,mobile accessories,"I‚Äôm writing the review after 1 month of usage . Also I previously owned iPhone 6 (5 years old) and one plus x (5 years old). So I believe in sustainable and lasting products with keeping up to the most useful technologies available in mobility world . Coming down to the Pros & Cons :- Cons:- 1. No power adaptor available in the kit. 2. Dual sim might create certain call drop situations 1/25 times it did happen . Pros :- 1. Battery is simply amazing and incomparable to any other device due to old school display. 2. Bazzle looks huge for couple of days & your eyes will be perfectly aligned to its cuts within 8 days of usage (4 hours on screen /day) 3. Within 2 weeks you will simply start loving the display and resolution 4. The refresh rate is too good considering the display resolution (Lightning fast) 5. Sound output is Dolby stereo apple technology . 6. The AppStore and interface to xR is the best amongst all. 7. measurement and scale is the new virtual useful tool for any purpose . 8. Camera is superb considering the colour output and exposure balance AI bionic chip gets the most output from 12MP lens . Verdict : if you value your money and want to restrict yourself from unnecessary usage of smartphone and control the upgrade every year to something uncommon and new , this is the phone you must go for ! iPhone XR . If you truly want different interface every 6 months or 1 year then prefer settling to the range and your budget accordingly . Spending 1/2 a lac to get bored doesn‚Äôt sound fit to most common Indian families to which I belong . For me usage life of this device is - 6 years . (2019 October) Refer the battery charging duration for iPhone XR using Samsung travel adaptor fast charger"
159455,mobile,This is China phone cheap quality
144751,books,Nice book for building yr vocabulary
151745,mobile,"Product and build quality is just amazing . Worth the money paid . If you are expecting iPhone like red . then you will be disappointed please don't buy red colour , it looks more like pink than red."

110049,books,"The Theory of Everything' is a great work by the genius scientist Stephen Hawking. It consists seven lectures of him on ideas about the universe,black holes & even why time travels forward etc. His characteristic wit,the ability to make you understand the hardcore scientific theories in a very simple way makes it a good read even for people who aren't in touch with science or cosmolgy. It sure is a book that's worth your time. As for the book(not content),it's a special anniversary collection. Excellent binding,brilliant pages,cheap(got it for mere 100rs.),oh and I got a bookmark with this book too,thanks to Amazon for that."

After updating the software phone is working on Android Pie with lots of new features and blazing speed. Highly Recommended
127054,smartTv,Good
137575,smartTv,"If you are comparing this with Google Chromecast, just don't. Chromecast is nowhere nearly as good as Firetv. Amazon fire TV stick is way too better than Chromecast. I have used Chromecast for years and have recently switched to fire TV."

163963,mobile accessories,Very nice
160239,mobile accessories,"This phone doesn't qualify for 13k price segment, and feels more like 9k price segment. On specs sheet they have mentioned all the Hi-Fi tech but the fact is some components are at the lowest quality. To start with, the Futuristic In-display fingerprint reader is the worst i have ever used and seen and it doesn't work 90% of times and you will literally get irritated and depressed more from this one feature. I would suggest Xiaomi to keep fingerprint sensor at the back like their other flagships. The display is AMOLED and brightness and feel is good, but when it comes to resolution in viewing videos or playing games(PUBG) i feel the worst display ever. Build quality is good. camera quality is another gimmick, The photo clarity is good in main lens but in wide angle camera and depth sensor camera are just worst part of the camera segment. You will loose clarity as you switch between lenses. Andriod UI is really great. Performance wise the phone is good for normal call, text and internet usage and not good for hardcore games. Fast charging is really good and the battery life is also good. I will not suggest this phone to anyone as you can get better phones at lower price than this."
168942,mobile,its pretty easy to use just plug and play system nothing much. Im using it since last 1 year than giving this review to you all guys its very durable and i have even used it many smartphones and bluetooth speakers but it never crashed or got corrupted. Must buy product.

112492,smartTv,"Amazing product man, simply amazing. Basically if you're okay with Mac OS then close your eyes and go for it. Because at this price you won't get any windows laptop with a better build quality and performance (not gaming performance). Trackpad - Top notch...Keyboard - Amazing key travel. and we all know how good is. apple's build quality. ;) Loved it. P.S. Trust me I've done my research on laptops, this is the best pick in this category(under 60k)."
115974,mobile,"Battery life is very less , doesn't even charge lenovo k8 note fully twice ..Device takes nearly 8 hours to charge fully and does not even charge the mobile fully twice...Fake product does not have the security code as mentioned in the manual, cheating."

150160,mobile accessories,Perfect phone I liked it
170431,books,very nice
112426,mobile,Amazing powerhouse machine with beautiful screen. However it is not free of cons. Here are few I noticed: 1. There is no official way of transferring Whatsapp chat history 2. Truecaller could not intercept calls to provide caller id 3. No native support for call recording 4. Deleting individual messages (SMS) is a hassle. Wish they could've provided same mechanism like delete conversation or other messages i.e. left swipe 5. Could not clear all notifications in one go. Right cross button to clear all appears after a while 6. Waiting for official wireless charger as could not find reliable reviews for other brand chargers I'm using Mac for around 4 years now and there is no software glitch I've observed. The purpose of getting iPhone was to get similar reliable OS and software performance which might take some time for Android to catch up and I'm highly satisfied till now.

118330,refrigerator,Bought and used for a week . It's good only But when i bought from Amazon. It has been mentioned as we can Open and check. Delivery agent is not allowing us to check .and it's plug and play model. We can book installation from whirlpool. They are coming by next day for installation

139986,smartTv,"It's one of the most amazing product from amazon. It has the power to convert your normal TV into a smart one. It has Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar, Voot, Sony LIV, Zee5, Youtube and a firefox browser. Some of the contents are available but for most of then you need a subscription plan. If you don't have a Smart TV this product might help you in making your TV expierence better. Works with no lag. Would definately recommend this product."

134660,smartTv,"I don't understand how few people out here have ended up getting defective pieces. I purchased this phone 3 weeks ago and had been using an iPhone 5s until then and I must say, the delivered product is absolutely legit and genuine. For the sake of my satisfaction I verified it on Apple's website by putting in my iPhone's IMEI number so there's no doubt about the authenticity of the product these people are selling down here. Now mentioning my experience with this phone so far: 1) The quality of the iPhone I received is absolutely stunning and the performance is incredibly fast and fluid. I must say that this phone is a beast in terms of performance. In fact you wouldn't even notice any significant performance difference between an iPhone 7 and an iPhone 8 when it comes to day to day tasks. 2) The camera is top notch and helps you shoot DSLR level videos and click some crystal clear and crisp photos on this 4.7 inch device. Front facing camera is incredible and the Touch ID sensor is blazing fast in recognising your fingerprint. 3) The dual stereo speakers on this iPhone give you a very rich and dynamic music experience. This is coming from an active earphone user. 4) I'll say that the display on this iPhone isn't the best when you compare it to the latest Android phones but it's certainly not disappointing at all. 5) Battery life I feel is decent and can get you through a day easily if you aren't a very intense user."

The performance has been top notch, battery life is very good considering most of my days are moderate to heavy usage I still find 20-30 % battery the next day. Camera is good too but at time you miss the secondary lens for portraits and portraits don‚Äôt work on objects. Screen is just fine I have not noticed any major difference.

119169,mobile,Camera is worst. All the online reviews were misleading. All three camera are useless. Focus hunting in video recordings Slow motion and super slow motion seems to record at the same speed. Night sight and portrait mode does not work in google camera. Front camera is like 2megapixel. All pics are washed out. Battery life is not outstanding. Lots of Samsung's bloatware. Lags sometime while swiping in home screen ! Avoid this phone at any cost.

But phone on a whole is not giving me any reasons for regretting my discussion. Pros Face unlock is superfast Same is with fingerprint sensor Built quality looks awesome It gives a feel while holding it Comes with transparent back cover Best part WASP charger is awesome. Very very good response in games like pubg .. ND finally I can also see people lying in grass which was a bit difficult in my iPhone 7 ,,üòÅ Cons Miss the stocks app of iPhone Camera is not that good means it's ok types. OnePlus ringtone is nothing infront of default apple ringtone Overall at this price it's far better updrade then going for iPhone 11 . It wins from iPhone 11 maybe loses from 11 pro. But it's a value for money product. Go for it."

Surprisingly, the Galaxy M30s weighs just 188 grams and is even lighter than most 4000mAh body phones in this price segment. Measuring 8.9mm in thickness, it isn‚Äôt exactly a svelte option, but it‚Äôs still very comfortable to wield and should be particularly appealing to consumers looking for big battery phones"

157036,mobile accessories,The battery backup is the best as this device has oxygen os operating system. Sometimes the fingerprint sensor on the screen cannot scan the finger due to dust or some other reason but it works really well i personally use this device and its overall perfect package for gamers as well as those who have heavy use. Camera is also nice and it gives nice quality pictures from dual camera of 48 megapixel rear camera and for selfie there is 16 megapixel front camera. Its optimisation is just of another level . Though its costly but its worth it.

Overall performance is smooth, thanks to Qualcomm Snapdragon 660, and 4GB RAM. 64 GB version is enough for typical day to day usage and apps.

133101,mobile,"Hello friends, I am using this mobile from last 3 days. My overall impression is mobile is very good considering the price range. Let me give the detailed review step by step: 1. Display: Samsung's sAmoled displays are best in the market. I just love it. 2. Sound: The sound is quite loud and clear. It also has Dolby atoms which is a good feature to have. 3.Battery: The battery is whooping 6000 mah which can last up to 2 days with moderate usage. On heavy usage though it can last up to 1 day. 4. Perfomance: It has exynos 9611 processor with 6 GB ram which works really well if you are into gaming. Pubg works in high settings with no legs at all. 5.Design: The phone is little bulky but considering its 6000 mah battery that's good actually. Design could have been better though. 6. Camera: The camera is good but it could have been great. The images don't look punchier. I think software update should fix this. 7. User interface: Its awesome as always. Overall a great phone at this price but camera could be improved in next software update."

134144,mobile,I bought iPhone X from amazon almost 1month ago and im happy you this beauty. Moved from OnePlus 5T a flagship killer to the worlds top brand who everyone wants to afford Apple. I‚Äôm pleased to inform this was worth selecting. Design is best in class. Battery life is good as per my usage it works for a good 1day and I still have 40% remaining battery life. I wish apple gives wireless charger in the box. As this supports but we need to pay some 3000rs for an additional wireless charger. Wat ever it is. The is a killer.
140877,smartTv,"It‚Äôs an integral part of my desk. I take phone calls, listen to music plus looks great. Can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs so small yet powerful. It also has automatic off when you don‚Äôt use it for more than 10 mins. Must buy."
111154,mobile,Actual battery is far lesser than 6000mah 80 % battery consumed in 1day. Its similer to my earlier phone having 3500mah. Disappointed with battery performance.
133643,mobile,I am disappointed with the camera quality when you click photo with 48 megapixel then it takes too many times to save the photo. Samsung must to solve problem with next update. The quality of selfie camera also must be update. And fingerprint sensor is also quite slow hope Samsung will resolve the problem after next Android 10 update. Otherwise overall performance is very good I am facing no problem and I am using this mobile for more than 10 days. Thank you Samsungfor making a very good smartphone within the price range of 17000. According to me there is no other smartphone within the price range of 20000 comparison to this Samsung m30 s. Samsung m30s is too much better then recently launched Realme XT and Redmi Note 8 Pro yes I am using all of this 3 mobile.
163485,mobile,Very good product from Xiaomi.
124129,mobile accessories,"First impressions, the plastic is creaky, feels cheap and is a complete fingerprint magnet. Doesn't come with a pre-applied screen protector, TPU case or Gorilla glass but it comes with a screen protection plan courtesy of Acko. Rest of the specs are good on paper and makes the phone quite snappy to use, the camera is decent and the screen is good as expected from Samsung and the phone doesn't feel bulky despite having a 6000mAh battery. Can't really complain for the 11400 I paid for it and it's definitely a better option than Vivo, Oppo, Realme, Xiaomi, etc at this price range"
117957,mobile accessories,"Best thing about this phone is it's performance, camera and battery. Honor is best. Go for it. I have attached two pictures taken from view20"
159748,smartTv,"This is my 1st ever Apple purchase for me. Till now I don't have any complaints but if you compare 1 to 1 features with any of the premium phones available in the market. It lags behind. You can buy it if you want a brand name, security, and fast phone. If you want a bright screen, better battery backup, premium looks and loaded with features then this phone is not for you. Pros: - If compared with previous version - Improved cameras (Front and Rear), screen and battery life. - Faster than any other smartphone available. - Water resistance - Powerful dual speakers (Better than any other phone) - Good Storage space. Cons: - Iterative design - Many of the ""groundbreaking"" features have been on Android phones for a while. - It's expensive if features are compared with another premium phone."
156515,books,"THINK AND GROW RICH BY NAPOLEON HILL Hello guys i am back with another self help book (looks like its going to be a revolutionary year for me with these self help book lined by my bed side). This book is a step by step guide to success. The first chapter start with desire then hop on to faith then to auto suggestion then to specialized knowledge and ultimately reach to how to outwit the six ghost of fear. There are lots of activities that are mentioned in this book, which one must do to get full advantage of it. It emphasis its reader to think and then take decision. If you are thinking there will be some quick mantras for success then don't. This book tells how to be persistent, have faith and what steps one should take in order to reach a most suitable decision. Lots of part is described with help of points making easy for the reader. Every now and then live examples are being quoted, therefore increasing readers faith in the book with every page he turns. It also talks about the qualities of a successful leader. Book basically tells that there is no substitution for hard work and burning will power is the basic key to achieve something in life. I would suggest to read this book really slow, understanding each and every thing."
134444,mobile accessories,"I brought this M30S in 6/128 GB blue variant and after use of 20 days i can say it fail in strd level. Poor camera quality, poor speaker and many lags. I purchased cell after long time and feeling sad it didnt deliver as my expection. Gaming experience is worst on this cell, i can't even imagine what will be result of its smaller version users. Anyway its my fault, I should've wait for reviews and should've purchased higher model. My final word wait for better option."
133142,mobile,Here is what I feel about the mobile. If you have budget to spend 36000 rupees (which will easily be used for 3-4 years so ROI is pretty cool) either in single payment or through EMI. I suggest to go for it. Its a great phone in the price tag. Once a smart person said : You cannot go wrong with oneplus and I felt the same way. Hit Features of the phone : The 90Hz display is a delight to work with. Camera. The software(it's as important as the great specs a phone offers) Smallest notch. Audio quality. Premium looks and feel. Shortcomings: Sab maaf..!! People are complaining about it's battery life. Though it's early to say but it has a pretty decent battery backup and fast charging is again what makes this phone a strong buy. What I want to say is I loved this and won't disappoint you either ..!! ‚ù§Ô∏è

129461,smartTv,Good picture quality & sound. Take only 4 hrs for installation after installation request. Good service by Mi.....
134015,mobile,I am writing my genuine review after using a week.. Battery: the valid thing in the phone is 6000mah battery .. its last more that 48hrs of moderate usage and 3days for minimal usage .. I request samsung have to optimize few steps to improve and charging speed of the battery.. it take 2.30 min to full.. I have to wait till a movie ends (lol)..but not a issue... Display: samsung done great job in the display amoled .. punchy colors and clarity.. it's too good... Build: for making a budget mid ranger from a reputed brand .. plastic build is acceptable... it get scratches so better use protection... Camera: I expected this camera has equivalent to realme xt or vivo x pro.. but samsung made us very disappointment with the camera.. this tri camera makes device look but camera have to improve much much ... low light its performing some times decent.. normal pictures are looks like very low pixelated... like an 5mp cam.. this may be fix from software updates.. expecting better update... else this phone can't beat its competitors.. with just 6000 battery.. against their in display fp and camera competitions.. Good luck samsung.. Over all a budget phone .. my suggestion is do you want good display and battery and useful one ui features with samsung brand just go for. It else just wait for till a update to recover their camera clarity ...

153739,mobile accessories,"Samsung has seen its number one market share position in India swallowed by Xiaomi, in exactly the same way that it overtook Nokia many years ago. The company has tried to respond in several different ways over the years, but very few of its recent low-cost offerings have been competitive enough in our reviews and ratings. The Korean giant has used its youth-focused J-series and software features such as S Bike Mode to address the budget market, but that just can't compare to the big screens, powerful processors, and tonnes of storage that Xiaomi and others offer at the same prices. It's finally time for a complete strategy reset, and so now we have the brand new Samsung Galaxy M-series. The two newly announced models, the Samsung Galaxy M10 (Review) and Samsung Galaxy M20, are launching in India before anywhere else, which shows how important it is for the company to recapture this market. Strategy aside, the new Galaxy M series represents a huge shift for the company in terms of design and specifications. There's no doubt that these phones are aimed squarely at Xiaomi, Honor, Realme, and Asus. It seems almost as though Samsung went out into the market with a checklist and tried to figure out every last little thing that these companies do in their perpetual race to one-up each other. Today, we have the more capable and higher priced of the two models, the Galaxy M20, for review. Let's find out whether Samsung's gamble has paid off, and whether it has finally managed to get the price, features, and performance right. Samsung Galaxy M20 design Put simply, this phone does not look or feel like any existing Samsung phone. It's extremely generic and could pass off for something from any of a handful of other manufacturers. Head-on, it's virtually indistinguishable from the Realme U1 (Review) or Oppo F9 (Review), for example. More than a criticism of Samsung though, this says more about how little scope there is for individuality when reducing a phone's features to such a degree of minimalism. The biggest departure from previous Samsung designs is the waterdrop-style 'Infinity-V' notch at the top of the screen, which is just big enough for the front camera to fit into. The screen measures 6.3 inches diagonally with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and rounded corners in keeping with current trends. There is a bit of a chin at the bottom of the screen ‚Äî interestingly, if you place the Galaxy M20 and Galaxy M10 side by side, you'll see that they look identical except that the Galaxy M20 has a taller screen and narrower chin, for a screen-to-body ratio exceeding 90 precent. The top and side borders around the screen do look narrow, but the sides of this phone bulge outwards considerably. This helps allow the earpiece to be placed within the frame, above the screen notch. There is an ambient light sensor, but it can't be seen. The proximity sensor is to the left of the notch and that placement doesn't seem to have hurt its functionality. Both the Galaxy M20 and the Galaxy M10 will be sold in the same two colours, Ocean Blue and Charcoal Black. Our Galaxy M20 review unit is Ocean Blue, which does stand out. It's quite dark, with a glossy finish and a very fine grainy pattern that gives it some depth. Samsung hasn't said exactly what material it has used for the rear shell, but it feels plasticky. The rear and sides of this phone are a single moulded shell with no seams or even antenna lines. We're happy to note that despite being glossy, the rear of this phone isn't slippery at all. The sides of this phone are rounded, but it is bulky overall, thanks to the 5000mAh battery ‚Äî more on that in a bit. It's also quite thick and heavy, and we felt the weight after using it for extended periods. The Galaxy M10 is a lot lighter in comparison but it obviously doesn't have the huge battery. The Galaxy M20 has a USB Type-C port on the bottom, unlike the Micro-USB port on its less expensive sibling. The speaker grille is also on the bottom, whereas the Galaxy M10 has it on the lower rear. Another big difference between the two phones is that the Galaxy M20 has a fingerprint sensor on the rear ‚Äî the less expensive model doesn't have one at all. We found the sensor a bit too high for our index fingers to reach comfortably when holding the phone. Everything else is fairly standard ‚Äî there's a 3.5mm audio socket on the bottom, power and volume buttons on the right, and a tray on the left for two Nano-SIMs as well as a dedicated microSD card slot. The dual rear camera module has a tiny ridge around it to help prevent the lenses from getting scratched, but doesn't protrude at all. Overall, while the Samsung Galaxy M20 doesn't have much of an individual identity, it's more than good enough to take on its competition in the sub-Rs. 15,000 market. Every design choice has been made to support a feature that Samsung needs to offer. Samsung Galaxy M20 specifications and software The most interesting thing on the Galaxy M20's spec sheet is its brand new Exynos 7904 processor. This oddly named unit was launched less than two weeks ago, and was designed specifically for the value smartphone segment in India. It has two high-performance ARM Cortex-A73 cores running at 1.8GHz and six power-efficient ARM Cortex-A53 cores running at 1.6GHz, plus a Mali-G71 GPU. Samsung tends to use the same processors across a lot of models, sometimes over the course of several years. Since this is our first experience with the Exynos 7904, our benchmarks will tell us how it competes against the Qualcomm and MediaTek models that other manufacturers in this segment use. The Galaxy M20 is available with either 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage for Rs. 10,990, or 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage for Rs. 12,990. We have latter configuration for review, and a quick look at the market shows that many other models at this price level don't have as much RAM or storage, which could give Samsung an advantage. The rest of the specs are more commonly found in this price bracket. The screen resolution is 1080x2340, with a density of 409ppi. There's a 5000mAh battery, and Samsung says that the bundled 15W charger will fill it up quickly. Ten minutes of charging is supposed to be enough to enjoy three hours of videos or 11 hours of music playback. The primary rear camera is a 13-megapixel unit with an f/1.9 aperture, while the secondary camera has a 5-megapixel sensor and 120 degree field of view. The front camera has an 8-megapixel resolution. Dual VoLTE is supported, and you can use LTE on either SIM at any time. Samsung seems to have cut a few corners when it comes to the accessories in the box. Other than the 15W charger and USB Type-C cable, there's only a SIM eject pin ‚Äî there's no protective case or screen guard, and in a page out of the Xiaomi playbook, no headset. It's a little disappointing to see Android 8.1, but at least it was up to date with the January 2019 security patch at the time of our review. The Galaxy M20 runs the Samsung Experience UI, as the company's new One UI is still in its beta test phase. If you've used any recent Samsung phone, you won't find much that's new or different here. Unfortunately, another thing that hasn't changed is Samsung's eagerness to put ads everywhere. From the moment we first booted this phone, we were confronted by them. The entire lock screen is now an ad ‚Äì Samsung has integrated an app called Glance that shows a different photo or promotional item each time you wake this phone from sleep. Not only are the captions distracting, but they displace useful notifications. In just the first few hours of using this phone we saw repeated clickbait messages to drive traffic to websites or apps. Sometimes we were prompted to vote in polls about cricketers or consumer product brands. Some of them were just flat out ads. We eventually managed to disable this by choosing ‚ÄòWallpaper' rather than ‚ÄòWallpaper & Stories' when setting a new lock screen background image, but we shouldn't have had to dig as much as we did to figure out this workaround. If we had bought this phone, we'd be extremely aggravated by this level of intrusiveness, and we really think Samsung needs to dial back its monetisation efforts. Besides that, we also got the usual barrage of notification spam from the My Galaxy app and some of the other preloaded apps. No matter how many useful extra features a manufacturer's custom UI has, this is the kind of thing that makes us long for stock Android. Samsung Galaxy M20 performance, battery life, and cameras We didn't have any trouble using the Samsung Galaxy M20 for day-to-day tasks. Apps and light games ran without any trouble, and we multitasked quite heavily too. There was only the slightest hint of lag in the UI on rare occasions, but not enough for us to worry about. Face recognition took about a second to work sometimes, which was annoying, but the fingerprint sensor was very quick. The screen is bright and crisp, with good viewing angles. Videos looked good and games including Asphalt 9:Legends and PUBG Mobile ran fine at medium settings. We did feel the upper rear of this phone get a bit warm while gaming, which is not ideal. Samsung's UI has also adapted well enough to the notch. Single-handed use was a bit difficult, owing to how large the phone is, and adjusting our grip was sometimes awkward because of its weight. We were curious to see how the new Exynos 7904 SoC does in benchmarks, and it delivered good enough performance for this segment. Our AnTuTu score was 107,540 which is in the neighbourhood of what Qualcomm's Snapdragon 632 or Snapdragon 636 can achieve. Geekbench gave us 1,315 for single-core performance and 4,094 for multi-core performance. Graphics scores were disappointing, with GFXbench's T-rex scene running at only 22fps and the Manhattan 3.1 scene at just 7.1fps. Battery life in everyday use was extraordinarily good. We started our day unplugging the phone at around 8am, and used it as usual, with a bit of photography and a few short gaming sessions, and still had about 60 percent left in the evening. We were able to stretch till the middle of the next day without having to charge. However, our HD video loop test ran for only 12 hours, 53 minutes which was relatively disappointing, and other phones in this price class do better with smaller batteries. The camera app is easy to use and well laid out. Most options and modes are within easy reach, and it's always nice to be able to begin recording video with a single tap. We found that the camera was quick to lock focus and there didn't seem to be much shutter lag. There's a selector for the two cameras right above the shutter button, but it's easy to forget which camera is selected. The app remembers what you were using last, so it doesn't default back to the primary camera each time it's opened. You can enable a movable floating shutter button from the Settings, which could be useful. There are several stickers to choose from, including some that scale to faces automatically, and you can buy more through the Galaxy Apps store. The Pro mode is lacking in options ‚Äì you can control only the metering, exposure compensation, ISO, and white balance. Samsung Mall integration lets you take photos of objects to search for similar ones across multiple online stores, and in our experience the results were pretty good but not very specific. One noteworthy quirk is that the Live Focus mode only works on faces. You can't use it to get a depth effect on shots of ordinary objects, like you can on virtually every other phone. There's a beautification mode but no AI enhancement, which is something that other brands, especially Honor, are using to differentiate themselves. Photo quality was fairly disappointing. We didn't see the kind of detail and sharpness that we're used to from phones in the sub-Rs. 15,000 price segment. Shots taken in the daytime were looked good on the phone's own screen, but a closer inspection showed that textures weren't very realistic and finer details were lost. On the positive side, all shots were all in focus and colours were fairly vibrant. Quality was also noticeably poorer when using the secondary camera with the wide lens, and there was a significant fish-eye distortion. Low-light performance was way below par. Very few of our shots came out looking usable, even when taken directly under streetlamps or with plenty of artificial light. There was a lot of motion blurring and a massive loss of detail. Video was also just about okay. Recording goes up to 1080p, and there's no stabilisation which is perhaps understandable at this price level. We saw quite a bit of focus shifting when recording moving objects. The depth effect in Live Focus mode made shots look quite artificial to us. It also didn't help that face beautification was on by default, and dialled up too high. Beautification was also enabled by default when we switched to the front camera. Speaking of which, selfies were also just about acceptable. Verdict- Unlike some of its current competitors, Samsung has immense brand power. A lot of people might have chosen other options recently based on specifications and features, so having closed that gap, Samsung stands to regain a lot of the customers it has lost. Buying a Samsung phone doesn't feel like a gamble in the way that it might with less established brands. The Korean giant is capitalising on this in its Galaxy M-series marketing by underscoring its huge service network, spanning 1,650 service centres across over 6,000 talukas all over India. We've reviewed the higher-end variant of the Samsung Galaxy M20, with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, which is priced at Rs. 12,990. At the same price, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro (Review) offers similar specifications with the roughly equivalent Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor and better battery life. The Realme U1 (Review) and Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 (Review) both have 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, but more powerful processors and also better battery life in our tests. The race between all these models is pretty tight. It seems that the Galaxy M20 doesn't quite catch up to all of its rivals' advantages, but at least it is very competitive for the first time. We hope this is the beginning of a new era for Samsung."
131315,refrigerator,Got defective piece. Screw threads on tv rear body are bad. Installation guy recommended replacement. Waiting for replacement piece. Update: got replacement and works fine. Wifi keeps disconnecting some times. Everything else fine till now. Customer care also seems fine. They resolve issue first by video call on whatsapp if possible. Then if required send the technician. Worth money I would say.

Separate connector has to be used as normal port/jack for Earphone is not present in Handset, rather an extension to be used to connect the Earphone. Coming to Screen/Display, it is good in clarity, but the Navigation Buttons EATS Up the bottom space while displaying the content of image/videos.... I wish there could be customizable setting available to hide and unhide the Navigation button at Bottom. Battery is average - works for a Day with high usage."
158886,mobile accessories,"The value for money is a tricky here. It's a gamble. Though I know the camera is average. I bought this phone 15 days before for 12 k, now it's 11k. Feels like unlucky orrr cheated..... Since I hate the bigger phones, this phone is bit better for my choice with the trust on the brand name. Eventhough it's stock android, the adframe from the games still running on the phone, makes annoying."

The phone is fast and smooth, you don‚Äôt feel like you are having just 3Gb of RAM, it handles anything you through at it without a hitch. The phone does feel premium and at the same time delicate because the backside is glass,‚Äùas you know glass is glass and glass will break‚Äù. The pictures taken from the camera are good but the lack of night scape sort of things is a con. Overall the phone is great, although the side bezels are thick, you get used to it. The LCD screen does not lack anything compared to the OLED‚Äôs in day to day usage. You just stop thinking those things when you are using daily."

This come with a TFT display not a LCD display but still screen is reasonably good. Camera is average but still you get a secondary wide-angle lens which comes handy. One-ui has already replaced the experience ui on this device with a android pie update. Buy only if you love samsung else you can buy Redmi note 7s or asus Zenfone max fro m2.

162987,smartTv,"Very good audio quality considering size of the speaker. Battery levels are indeed holding up to advertised values for a new piece - Have been using it for a couple of hours a day for a week at low to mid volumes and haven't had to recharge it yet. One unexpected but useful feature was that the speaker can connect to 3 devices simultaneously for music. This feature is helpful at parties where multiple people want to play their playlists. The speaker will play music from the 1st phone until the music on that is stopped, at which point it will seamlessly switch over to the other phone. The speakerphone functionality of the unit is also quite good - with no echo. Used this as a speakerphone only 3-4 times so far, with no complaints from the other side. Overall a good product. Prices in India are 50%+ higher than in the US. So look out for discounts."

What i love about the phone- 1)Its screen 2)The phone is fast 3)Cameras (both front and rear) are great 4)Battery life is pretty good The only downside is the charging speed. The phone charges slow with the standard charging cable that comes out of the box. I personally feel, apple should have atleast given a fast charger with such an expensive device."

119963,refrigerator,"Compared to its predecessor, the Sony a7 III has been updated in almost every way; when compared to other similarly priced full frame options, the a7 III looks to be a cut above in many respects. For generalist photographers, wedding and event shooters and even sports specialists, the a7 III gets an awful lot of things just right. But as with previous Sony mirrorless full-frame cameras, there are some foibles that persist with this new model. When I first got my hands on this camera the first thing I noticed was that it looks just like my A7RIII. Not only does it look like it, it also feels like it. That‚Äôs nice, because I really liked the step up from the older generation of the A7 range mainly because of speed and the nice extra functions like touch screen and the menu system. I quickly set up the camera similar to my A7RII and went out shooting the next morning for sunrise."

In some points I feel MIA2 is better then MIA3. The phone is heating while chargin. (May be this issue is with my phone only)
159772,mobile accessories,"This is my first Samsung smartphone. Samsung's budget smartphone literally has got everything. The AMOLED display is excellent. Great battery life. Samsung gave no compromise on camera quality. The wide angle lens is just amazing. The fingerprint sensor has not been upto the mark.But I don't find it difficult. The other thing is that it is not a gaming phone. But games work fine in moderate mode. In my opinion this is one of the best smartphone below Rs20,000. I also recommended this phone to my cousin and he uses it."

143595,mobile,"NOTE: @ This is detailed comparison between iPhone 8, X, XS & XR, after using each of them for a month. @ I am also stating the detailed battery performance of each phone. This is a long review, but its worth if you willing to spend your hard earned money. BUILT QUALITY : -------------------- # iphone 8 and XR have glass front and back, ringed with metal frames (aluminum), which looks more premium and worth the price you pay. But also are susceptible to easy damages. # iphone X and XS are made of stainless steel, which don't appears that luxurious comparatively, but are more sturdier and less prone to damage compared to 8 and XR. # Among all iphone 8 is lightest and XR heaviest, with X and XS being almost similarly weighed. # To me in this parameter, iphone 8 seems the better choice. DISPLAY : ----------- # iphone 8 has smallest display(4.7"") and XR the biggest(6.1""), with X and XS with same size(5.8""), so is the screen to body ratio. # Display resolution of X and XS is same and the best amongst all, while 8 and XR is same and lowest ( NOT even FHD ). Similarly, X & XS have OLED, while 8 & XR have LCD :P # According to my usage I found X & XS to be much better value for money in terms of display quality. SYSTEM PERFORMANCE : ----------------------------- # I noticed XS performing slightly better than XR, though both of them have same processor. Followed by X and 8. # If you are normal user like me then you wont mind using iphone 8 over XS, as 8 can do everything that XS can easily. # I found X to be better value for money in this segment. BATTERY PERFORMANCE : ------------------------------ # All 4 phones are equipped with fast charging, wireless charging. # XR use to last over 20 hours with normal multitasking, with 4G ON continuously all the time. *XS use to last between 16-18 hours, X did 14-15 hours and 8 use to lasts upto 12 hours. # With Heavy multitasking, XR lasted over 11 hours, XS did over 9 hours, X lasted over 8 hours and 8 lasted upto 6 hours. # Certainly XR outshines others in battery performance. CAMERA : ----------- # In this segment, I noticed iphone X to be the best among all when using Rear camera. * Colours are more punchy and true to real. Night time photography is also excellent. # XS sometimes does better over X, but not always. # Front camera of X, XS and XR are same and performs almost similarly. # Each one supports 4K, OIS, slow motion. PRICE (64GB) : --------------- 8 - Rs.55K X - Rs.75K XR - Rs.77k XS - Rs.99K # Here certainly 8 is winner :P P.S: you get a physical home button on iphone 8, which certainly comes handy. VERDICT : ----------- After using each phone, I can conclude that if you are tight on budget then going for iphone 8 is best choice. If you have 80k to spare, then certainly go for iphone X. And if budget is not in your dictionary, then certainly go for iphone XS. To me iphone XR is not worth the price at all, except the battery performance, it doesn't have any noticeable parameter. If you already own a iphone 7, then don't upgrade unless, you have money to waste. If you have 6s or below, then only go for upgrade. Hope this review helps."

152484,mobile accessories,"Pros:- 1. Sound quality exellent. 2. Battery backup good 7 to 8 hours but it's intial days. 3. stylish and light to wear on neck. 4.

166589,mobile,Worth the price..
167198,smartTv,"at this date iphone 7 32gb is available for 50k. i believe that this could be the best price to buy this phone; but is it worth spending 50k? within a month from now samsung s8 is going to be in market, according to the promotion videos and leaks s8 is going to be the best and most beautiful phone ever. surely s8 will be the best looking phone with a lot of features nd other cool stuffs which other brands don't offer. but then people will judge me based on an os platform, its ios or its apple nd all. i would like you to be aware that apple is also going to make huge changes this year as their 10th anniversary and according to leaks and rumors all over the Internet it will somewhat look like Samsung s8 with edge display. you can check on youtube for visual ideas. my recommendation is that keep your hard earned money 50k for upcoming releases, if u are apple fan then u can go for iphone edition or if u wouldn't mind going to android then s8 is going to be the best phone this year. for me 50k is a huge amount of money, if 50k is just your pocket money and u think you can save another 50k till sept. then only u can think of buying iphone7. Because after the release of new iphone edition (or iphone 8 whatever apple is going to name it) iphone 7 is going to loose its value to very much extent. if u will go to sell 7 32gb then the chances arw u wont get more than 30k, and next iphone is surely be going to start at a price of 70-80k. so think wisely and analyse your needs and spend your money. 50k is not earned with a blink of eye."
127023,mobile,Good
113192,mobile,"As usual first quality sold by Amazon..Excellent build quality though the phone back panel made of plastic...the phone is really fulfil your needs and it can give good fight to top end phones.. Phone battery- normal usage stays for 2 days,with some game stays for 1.7 days. Camera quality- excellent quality at this price point. Processor- I don't feel any lag when playing high end games it feels strong and no heating problems. Display- Amoled display is super package with this mid range Overall - The phone can satisfy all your needs..according to my view... I can give 9.5 out of 10."

I was suggested by Amazon that either you can go for return the product or you can contact Haeir to replace the new tray and get back with the bill. Then Amazon will refund the amount. but Haeir people came to home and install the product and did the demo. They are ready to replace the Milk tray at free of cost since it is a manufacturing defect.

114169,mobile,"Awesome mobile in this price range, I am using oppo f9 pro , now comparing to this new realme u1 front camera, it's realme is better than f9 pro... both are 25 MP camera but real me is slightly good clarity.."
121016,mobile,"Don't know why this has so fewer üòû reviews here:- Here's my take on this ‚≠êÔ∏èLATEST FIRMWARE UPDATE:- It received SpO2 which measures your Blood oxygen level and heartbeat/minute. I bought it on a deal at 2299/- I gave it 5 stars and that's all for the reasons. I like the blue color over black because it looks different and sort of professional than the black color. This is what I think, your choice might be different. ‚úîÔ∏è So let's talk about the BUILT QUALITY first:- ------------------------------ 1- The screen is AMOLED Touch Display, it's very vibrant and the color looks too good. For such a small screen the text and graphics are very legible. It's very sharp and clean. 2- It has 2.5D Curved Glass, looks neat and bright. 3- Screen size is 0.95"" AMOLED Touch Display with Up to 282 PPI (wow!!!) üëç 5- The strap is rubber or resin sort of material, it's textured with watch kind of design and thus makes the band secure in your hand. ‚úîÔ∏è FIND PHONE:- üì± I really like the FIND PHONE feature, it rings your phone...very helpful if you forgot ü§î where have you kept your phone. ‚úîÔ∏è BATTERY LIFE:- ‚ö°Ô∏è As most of the reviews and honor itself claims it has 14 days of battery life, le de ke 8 se 10 din ki to milegi hi bro. And if you worry about portability it's not a big issue. So do not take it as its negative. The charging cradle is so small that it can fit in your pocket. ‚úîÔ∏è COMPARISON:- People comparing two bands these days Mi band 4 and Honor band 5. Now which one to go for? let me tell you both have almost near same specs and feature. But I like the built of Honor. I like its band quality, it feels secure in hand because of the watch kind of strap design. The Honor band also included SpO2 and Music control features now!! üòé The Mi band 4 has so many watch faces which you won't find on Honor band 5 but trust it's not a big issue for me. If you love faces you may go for Mi but Honor is top on accuracy. ‚úîÔ∏è FACES:- It has a total of 8 watch faces and it's not a big deal to cry. You do not have much time to change watch faces every minute...I feel 8 faces are cool for me. I attached pics of the faces...photos are not sharp because of light reflecting from the watch but it's super sharp in real!! ‚úîÔ∏è SCREEN QUALITY: Excellent 2.5D Curved Glass, 0.95"" AMOLED Touch Display with Up to 282 PPI. The pixel density is amazing for such a small screen. ‚úîÔ∏è TOUCH:- Touch is not buggy and has no lag at all. It's a smooth swipe. ‚úîÔ∏è BRIGHTNESS:- You can change the brightness to low to full. However, under direct sunlight, it feels a little dim but not an issue of tension. ‚úîÔ∏è FEATURES: 1- Latest firmware included SpO2 ‚ù§Ô∏è and Music control üéµ features which were missing earlier in India unit. I'm using the music feature with Apple Music on my Android phone. It can pair with any media player on your android phone üì± 2- Home screen is beautiful and tells you about: a) Time b) Day and date c) Steps d) Calorie burnt e) Distance travelled in KMs 3- Additional screens are:- a) Music b) More c)Messages d) Workout e) Sleep tracker f) SpO2 g) Heart rate h) Steps Under MORE icon you have:- timer, stopwatch, faces, find phone, brightness, screen on, battery, system The steps taken by me is almost identical to the Google fit app on my phone. ‚úîÔ∏è VARIOUS FITNESS MODES:- a) outdoor run b) indoor run c) outdoor walk d) indoor walk e) indoor cycle f) cross trainer g) swimming h) rower i) Free training. ‚úîÔ∏è SPO2:- I've compared its SpO2 with my real Oximeter and both showing the same reading. Now you can conclude how accurate it is on Honor band 5 üò≤ The 24/7 Heart Rate Monitor is very accurate üëå too and shows the exact+- reading matching to my real Oximeter. ‚úîÔ∏è HONOR ANDROID APP (Huawei Health):- the Honor app for android has very intuitive UI, lets you customize features on your watch. Firmware updates have been done using the app itself. Connection is very easy using Bluetooth of your mobile.

159093,smartTv,"There's NOTHING smart about this TV. Netflix, Amazon primevideo donot work with the TV. Unfortunately, I found this out after purchasing the TV. The interface: The Google TV interface is an absolute pain! Takes a while to boot and every task is time consuming. When the TV is switched on, the home screen opens by default. From there it is required to switch to the desired source. The remote: There isn't a mute button on this remote! Are you kidding me, Xiaomi? Even the source cannot be switched, or the picture settings/brightness cannot be adjusted without going back to the Android home screen! On the plus side, the picture quality isn't bad and Amazon music, Hotstar do work. Definitely would not recommend. Instead, buy a decent non smart LED TV and a Chromecast/fire TV stick to go with."

121059,mobile accessories,Don't waste your hard earned money. First day itself it got scratches then I realise there is no protection used in display. Amazon people don't even consider for return as flipkart do. Realme phones are far better and cheaper. It's camera performance is equivalent to some 15000 phone in market.
112676,mobile,Amazon has cheated me. As its rear camera is so worse. Its performance is even 2 megapixel. Display having granular type of vibrating stuff if camera is going on. Totally a waste product.

157580,mobile,The features of the phone are very good. Camera and the operating system. The battery life is not as promised in the various writeups and the ads.
153515,mobile,"Reviewing the device after a months of usage. I have always been keen on using a new os and getting an experience. Have used the windows phone, the blackberry, and from last three years was with android and then during the big billion sale got an amazing offer on this iphone xr. Speaking of the device everything is good right from the display to the battery. People tend to compare devices with specs alone which is wrong. iOS offers different experience in terms of response, feedback, security, UI , etc. Camera is fabulous like no body ever complained on the photo or video clicked. The only downside as its kinda heavy ~200 grams. Battery life is good for me as it goes more than a day with full charge. Ram management is excellent, not a single lag in the course of one month usage. The display is colour accurate and is very bright. Yes its an LCD but no complaints out there. Network reception is strong and the speakers are true stereo. Would just say if you are the one who is bored with the chinese android and wants to use the apple flavour , this will be a good purchase."

120351,mobile,Definitely worth more than its price. Samsung has gone out of the way in an attempt to make its stand in the market with this mid range mobile phone. Battery is very powerful. Mine is still 53% after full day use yesterday. Camera is wonderful and pictures are much clearer as compared to other phones (checked with office colleagues) with similar configuration. Though RAM is 6 GB but 2.3 gb is used by system. Looks wise it is good with its sleek design and different color variants (mine is sapphire blue). Overall it is a really good choice to buy without any 2nd thoughts.
125725,mobile,Good
115460,mobile,"Battery backup is very very bad, I full charged this phone 3 to 4 times in a day. Finger print scanner not working in one touch, it work in 3 to 4 touch. Camera quality is not good. There is no option for privacy app encryption. There is no option for face unlock."

134981,mobile,"I had a dilemma of buying realme 5 pro or Samsung Galaxy M30s. But finally I chose Samsung, and I am glad. The biggest spec I like is 6000 mAh battery. If you are a mild user, not using games, then it will work almost 3 days, a heavy user can use it for 2 days in a single full charge. For a test, I charged it 100 % and used it till it switches off automatically. It worked beautifully even in 2% battery( more than 30 minutes). Lets see what happens when it gets old. Any phone works good when its new. Camera is fine. Fingerprint is a second slower than Mi and Realme phones. sAMOLED display is the main thing which distinguishes it better than other phones. It shows more beautiful clear colors, specially black, than LCD screens. It feels awesome to touch the sAMOLED screen while navigation. The hardware of phone is cheap, plastic material. But feels good when you carry it, as its lighter phone despite having massive battery capacity. After 10 days of using this phone, I have no objection over its performance, I played Call Of Duty Mobile efficiently. The Exynos processor works smoothly. Camera clicks really good 48 MP pictures, but still it needs better pixel density. It does not make a crow a swan like oppo phones do. But if you like pics as originals, without or with some slight effects and filters, my friend grab the monster. The charger is OK, 15 W is slower for 6000 mAh battery, it charges the phone full in about 2.5 hrs. It would have been better if 18 W or more provided. Then too, at this price range, what more can you expect? Above all, you get only a phone, sim ejector pin, a charger adapter with USB Type C cable with some paperworks inside the product box. Dear Samsung, thats so rude. No back cover or screenguard provided, its called Kanjoosi. Depends on what you need in a phone, I needed massive battery capacity in a phone, as I reside in such place where electricity supply is not good. So its a good phone for me. The reason I am giving it 4 star is because of its non-premium hardware, meagre 15 W charger, and non- availability of accesories. Remember one thing, Phones do get old now in just one month, so I will not recommened you to buy it 3 months later."

123551,refrigerator,Fantastic tv in 10000 rs
111242,smartTv,"After 2 weeks of usage At 70K this TV is certainly value for money. If you are planning to purchase please keep these in mind. 1) There are lot of algorithms that the TV uses to enhance your picture/video viewing quality to match 4K HDR10 rendering. Hence by default a frame rate enhancer is enabled which makes FHD appear as 4K. I personally did not like it. It makes the whole experience as if viewing a mobile recorded video. I turned it appear and everything is perfect. Remember as satellite TV consumers, most are are still at FHD content consumption. 2) The space between your wall/TV Unit and TV is very small (I mean really really small). The default wall mount almost gives no breathing space to the TV. So I got additional spacers that increased the gap by 1.5 inches. Little better but still not best if you need to access ports on the backside. I would soon be upgrading to a flexible wall mount that allows pulling/pushing TV 3) I liked the TV border with silver color. Not all may like it. Please see renders before you purchase. 4) Built-in Bluetooth works like a charm. The built-in speakers are generally very decent for a LED TV. However I did use external speakers as I need more clarity and bass. 5) I experienced stutter in screen mirroring when playing 4K videos on TV when the TV is Wifi connected. I certainly find this as a nuisance because we would need to leave the TV on Wifi (after all its Smart TV and I mostly use it for that). I returned my first unit which had the same issue. Its there on the replaced unit as well. Hence would assume this is inherent to this model. 6) You have youtube, Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos built-in. Experience of Netflix on this TV is simply AWESOME. I will add more soon"
150588,mobile,Phone is having a overheat issue. When I connect to Wifi or connect device to TV - phone is getting too much heat. Even seeing little heat when I keep phone in pocket and go out. - Is this problem with all devices or specific issue only with my device?

135144,mobile accessories,"I have been using it for over 20 days now, Pros 1. Pictures in day light are amazing 2. Fast, there is no lag whatsoever on running asphalt xtreme, I have continuously play for 40 minutes. The phone did heat up a bit but it's common now a days. 3. Comparing the price to product, it is an amazing buy. 4. Many claimed that the charging port does not work properly over long run. Its only 20 days, haven't faced that issue yet. 5. Battery life is huge, I have charged it 100%, with minimum usage it lasted more than two days. Heavy usage it lasted nearly a day. Cons. 1. The touch sometimes does not read properly. It becomes annoying sometimes. 2. Low light camera is a big con. Images loose their sharpness and video quality in low light flickers. I wish it had on-screen finger-scanner, because lot of mobile companies are offering this feature in this price range. LED notification a useful feature missing."
122977,mobile accessories,Excellent product. I use these more than Mivi Collar Playback time: 6 hrs Bass: you won't be disappointed. Thumping bass Mids and trebble is above average Noise isolation is really good These offer superior quality for the price you pay

141093,mobile,"Just Superb...its a real Monster which you will love to live with. Recieved it in well packed condition well in time without any observation. Phone is having remarkable performance in almost every function n use conditions. It has a battery which will really shock you as everytime you will go to connect it for charging and you will find its reduced not even for one percent. Battery is the core Monster of this phone which hardly gets exhausted. Camera is very good not as compared to I phone etc, but still the best in its range. Some features of the camera are latest and unique. Speed is awesome with no other demerits such as heating etc. Rest all great. A very good phone which has the stuff as a phone costing beyond 30000 I believe. Value more than money spent...Must bye."

112172,mobile,Amazing battery life. I don't know how fingerprint reader works. I haven't done fingerprint settings but my earlier Mi would unlock if I touched the fingerprint reader (even without settings). Howver I am happy with double tapping screen to unlock it. The glance part on lock screen is a bit annoying and I don't k ow how to remove it. Overall great product and excellent value for money.

114027,refrigerator,"Awesome camera.I have been using this for 3 weeks with lens 18-135 kit lens . Though its a good zoom lens 18- 135 , it is not a speed lens ( f3.5 - f 5.6 ) , so less depth of field Only thing to get shallow depth of field on this lens is to put at 135 mm and shoot at a distance . Normally for portraits , the sweet spot would be between 50 - 85 mm . On this range the kit lens has an fstop min 4.5 which is pretty bad. This is an okay lens which will work for different purposes. For portraits and lowlights I recommend 50mm 1.8 STM lens. It gives good shallow DOF and nyc bokeh. Kindly use perfect cleaning kit - like the zeiss ."

But this product doesn't last long for sure, coz I'm using this product since 2months and the cable had broken at 3.5mm connector's place coz of simple bend that i did when i put my phone connected with earphones into the pocket for some 3-4days while i was walking. So if u dont put ur phone in your pocket with earphones connected then it wont break for some time, and if u want best sounding experience u could buy this.So I recommend this product on the basis of music quality and dont recommend on durability and reliability....

A beginner or a mid beginner would never regret buying this. ""Do not compare it with others unless you get rid of the kit lens first"". A good glass is much more important than the body. All I have to say about the service is that Amazon is amazing, it was delivered in 3 days, which was much before estimated time."

111522,mobile,"After using this with SONY MDR-EX150AP and CX180. Sound qulity: cx180 lil bit driven by clarity, jbl lil bit driven by base, prefer sony because it has right proportion of base and clarity. Mic: cx180 doesn't have mic others two have. Durability: cx180 don't even last 3 months. One side stopped working, though I had repaired I was not satisfied with the durability. Sony and jbl still working fine. Will have to see, both seems durable. Comfort: Normal use SONY feels more snuggly and comfortable. JBL comes out often while you are using(I tried changing the bud with lil bigger one but it feels uncomfortable, I'm using with spare bud that's included with my sony headphone and now feels ok). CX 180 fits and feels well but not upto the mark of SONY but while sleeping CX180 is more comfortable because of its less protruding design. ***JBL- Other nearby people can easily hear what you are listening (slightly better when used with sony buds) Price: JBL wins. So you decide."

When you click a photo, it wont click(Clicks after 5 seconds). 2. When you want to switch to video, it wont switch. 3. When you click on any button, it wont click. You end up clicking multiple times. 4. Cant attend calls, gets hung. Apart from the above, 1. Call & Music Volume is very low. Earphones & Speakers(Both speakers). 2. Battery life is very ordinary 3. Its comparable to my iron box when comes to the heat. 4. Brightness is very low. You cant read whats in screen in outdoors."

151335,smartTv,"Pls go for the full HD screen, this ones screen is pathetic."
128199,smartTv,Good entry level laptop for normal use. Based on Intel Core i3 7th Generation. No OS is provided but can be installed from local shops or by yourself. The only drawback is that no DVD drive is provided. So installing softwares provided with CD/DVD will be a tedious process. Has got good battery life. No games were tested and hence no opinion. But overall a good laptop for normal use at this price level. Highly recommended.
133221,mobile,"Hi Team, Bought two iPhone XR‚Äôs on 29 September 2019[as already an iPhone user and die-heart iPhone fan], with lot of expectations, but the sound quality of headphones is exceptionally bad. To compare tested with 50 Rs headphone on old iPhone 5s, it works dramatically fabulous compared with iPhone XR headphones. I want to return both the iPhones, or replace with properly tested headphones. Never had such experience with iPhone earlier, such incidents tarnish iPhone image."
118485,mobile accessories,"Bought this phone with high hopes, as it happens to be the 3rd variant in the Android One offerings from Xiaomi. But sadly, it doesn't entirely live up to the expectations. Processor, RAM and storage are good enough for a lag free experience. The 3.5mm audio jack is back again. Screen size is adequate, but the quality of the screen is definitely a let-down. Looking closely, the pixels are distinctly visible. Consequently, screen elements like icons, text font have jagged edges, probably because of lower pixel density. In contrast, the Mi A1(on which I am writing this review) has a superior display, even though it's not a notched display. Camera quality is average. The on-screen fingerprint reader isn't accurate and fast enough, so while it may take 2-3 seconds to unlock sometimes, it may even require multiple tries at other times. Again, the Mi A1, which has a dedicated fingerprint reader, has a much faster fingerprint recognition and unlock. Nevertheless, some of the things are good about the phone such as the stock Android experience without bloatware, and a good battery life. Comes shipped with a standard charger and back cover. It is a decent buy, given that there aren't many Android One phones still on the market, and if one is willing to look the other way, in terms of display, fingerprint reader and camera."
114053,mobile,"Awesome display, sound output over bluetooth and over headphone Jack. I am able to use this phone for 2 days without recharge. When I used my earphone with phone, I was astonished with the sound quality and clarity it is having. It is almost like use DAC. Phone speakers are ok ok. Please note you won't get Dolby in speakers. You can use Dolby output in bluetooth and headphone Jack output. Display quality is the best. Videos and games will look good to the eyes. I observed that fingerprint sensor is little bit slow but it is ok as long as it is secure. I will prefer security over speed. Camera is not that great. You can get good pics in daylight but in low light pics are not that good. Video stabilization is the best ever seen. Personally I found One UI satisfying. It have good memory management, good process management than other phones like redmi and real me. Plus one one UI comes with flagship features which you can use in this phone. Games performance is good.(redmi note 8 pro is better due to its graphics processor but this have better visuals and optimum performance). In the end I'll recommend this phone to all types of users. Specially to who lives Netflix and music."

157664,smartTv,"The iPhone 7 was launched back in 2016 and was an instant hit when it launched, similar to other iPhones. Also similar to iPhones is just how well this phone has aged. Compared to other flagships released at that time, the iPhone 7 has better performance and has even held on to it's value well. But it's 2019, and there is a ton of competition where the iPhone 7 stands. First thing's first, if you're not adamant about getting an iPhone, don't consider the iPhone 7. The OnePlus 6T is one phone which can be bought at a similar price point and is better in almost every way. If you have to buy an iPhone at this price point, the iPhone 7 is still a solid device. It has- 1. Decent display 2. Decent performance 3. Will still get software updates for the next 2 years. 4. Good resale value 5. Good bragging value 6. Compact size 7. A more secure software experience 8. Very good camera All in all, you get the benefits of the iOS eco system as a whole when you buy the iPhone 7. All the components of the phone today are what we can call great but not mind blowing. To someone looking for a compact, well rounded smartphone with 2-3 years of usable life left, I would whole heartedly recommend the iPhone 7. However, if the price was closer to the Rs 30K segment, this phone would have been absolutely killer."

119235,mobile,Camera quality Worst camera quality.couldnt even match with Redmi phones.total 40k is a waste.Wgem zoomed the pixels are.appearing dotted.I didn't expect this even after doing the update for camera. I mainly bought this mobile for camera clarity only.But it is worser compared to the previous versions.A mistake done. Finger print is very good. Screen sensitivity is very good. Slowmo effect is good. Super macro is good.
113286,mobile,"At this price tag samsung has not offered front flash...i came to know about this today as i was kliking picture in a dark room n got surprised knowing this fact...so thought to write review. Overall phone is very good. Nice battery performance,camera,music...color. But at last it is a utter disappointment not having front flash. So i request buyers go for other brand at same price tag rather than going for samsung m30s."

110063,mobile,"*After about a week update : poor battery life, definitely not more than a regular 3500mah phone. Also their fast charging is nothing longer the VOOC charging of oppo phones :-( Had very big expectations from this phone but not up to mark.. I just got mine 2 days ago, so it's a bit too early to judge. The camera both front and back are satisfactory and deliver good color reproduction as well. If you want a DSLR quality picture, then better to go buy a DSLR itself, but for any average user, the quality of picture from both cameras are more than satisfactory. Even the low light photos are 100% better than my old iPhone 7 plus. The phone's 6000mah battery adds to its overall weight, though it's considerably lighter than most models with similar display and half it's battery size. I was smitten by the light weight A series models but went for this one owing to its camera and battery specs. The phone did not come with a ton of unwanted apps and most can be uninstalled. There were some apps that got removed from the homescreen when I "" uninstalled"" it bit where showing up in the apps settings, but could be deleted again from there as well. The settings panel though not as good as my oppo F9pro gets some time getting used to, but has most features available for customization. Also the swipe feature for typing has been maintained even though I do not see controls for adjusting its speed/ lag which is a tad bit disappointing. Processing speed for opening and loading apps is a bit slower than my oppo F9 pro with the same 6GB ram configuration, but not too irritatingly slow. Had trouble loading Amazon app a few times but right now working perfectly well. Next comes the ""fast charging"". Its faster than most normal C type cable ones, but doubtful if it's as fast as the VOOC charger of Oppo. But then again the battery capacity is almost double than in F9pro and may be that's why feeling that it's not fast enough. Battery life and heating on continuous usage is yet to be seen. I've binged watched videos all day long in my oppo and had faced no hearing issues, hoping that Samsung will also not disappoint me in that area. Haven't installed any games yet so can't comment on its performance in real time processor intensive ones. One thing I've noticed, that was pointed out by another reviewer as well is the signal strength. I'm hardly getting 1-2 bars inside my home where I used to get 2-3 in my oppo easily. Yet to see how it's going to affect the battery life ! Overall it's not a bad buy,if you have good signal strength in your commute area, battery should also last longer."

135248,mobile,I have bought this recently.. I feel it's so slim and nice to carry. But few of the things I just wanted to mention.. 1. Radio jack port is not available .. every time you need to carry external small cable given as USB supported to put radio jack. So need to carry all the times. 2. Sound quality.. when I put max then only it is audible clearly. Average if I put.. it's hearing very low. Hence always max required. 3. Back camera is not good. Of course given in device spec. 4. Battery backup is good. 5. Location service will be automatically make on when you open any location services app. So no short cut provided in status bar menu.

154489,mobile accessories,"So After Using The Phone 20-21 Days, Here's my Honest Feedback. **I was Not Much Samsung Fan since starting due to its reviews related lagging and Less battery back-up, But this time M30 changed my opinion for Samsung.** -It has FHD+ super AMOLED Of 6.4"" which Adds the beauty to your vision. -5000mAh Battery Is Cherry On Cake, Sometimes I need to drain the battery forcefully just to charge it from 0%. Prefer Charging Phone After fully drain, It helps to increase battery life as well as battery back-up. Using it for whole day, still, 35%-40% remains. sometimes it depends upon your use. You might need a whole battery for a day if you're a heavy user. Though I more into camera & Gaming, I find minimum 30% remaining battery at the end of the day. -USB C-Type Provides the fast charging so, Total Charging time required is 2Hours30Minutes from 00% to 100%. -Camera Quality Is Awesome, Wide Angle Camera Gives a feel of GoPro Sometimes. It Won't let you down in case case camera. -Exynos 7904 Octa-Core Processor makes it more smooth and more fine to use. -Running On 1Ui + Android 9, Makes your experience friendly. -Its SAR Value makes it health-friendly too. -Slim Body Just Enhance your experience. Conclusion Using it for 20-21 days, I actually think, it worths the money. You might not get such amazing phone under this budget. I'll have to find cons to mention but as of now, I haven't find any."

116835,mobile,Best budget phone i got it only 7599
148822,mobile,One of the best phone available in market
152383,mobile accessories,Pros: * Awesome camera and battery * Fast charging is available * Blue light filter * Sleek body and infinity screen * Improved Biometrics Cons: * No new features as such in the phone * Pre-installed Samsung apps can be a bit daunting
118362,mobile,Bought it during the second great indian sale for 41k. Though 3k higher than the 1st sale I am very happy to buy it as I know it‚Äôs a good deal. I am very much statisfied with the phone quality and delivery speed. But the packing quality should improve.

169190,mobile,nice
146783,mobile accessories,No doubt Sound quality is fantastic. Noise cancellation I would say not very good but some extent ok. Finally Bluetooth connectivity is not very poor and it doesn‚Äôt work even within another corner in room. If you are ok with compromising Bluetooth connectivity than this might be good product in this price.
128659,mobile,Good on all features.. But oneplus can give battery capacity more for long lasting...

153548,smartTv,Rubbish service by both Amazon and Apple. The I phone 7 jet black 32GB I bought stopped working and blacked out in just 2 days after delivery. Amazon can't replace and says talk to Apple and Apple says on Apple website they don't have I phone 7 jet black listed under 32GB offering. This has landed me in a no mans land as they say it will take 10 working days for the issue to get resolved . It's frustrating with a new iphone. Also more when the option to return doesn't work for this product. I am never going to buy iPhone from Amazon going forward as one doesn't know if the product received would be defective or not.

143427,mobile,"My first impression about Vivo U10... 1. The design of this device is quite impressive and stylish and the built quality is also very good. 2. The device is little heavy and big in size. 3. Camera quality is also very good in this price range, wide angle mood is fantastic. But, there are very few features in camera mode (AI sticker mode and document scan mode are not present). 4. There are so many attractive features in smart motion settings. 5. Speaker is producing low sound. 6. Device is very fast. 7.Battery life is excellent. (I will update my review after using the device for few days...)"

151997,mobile,Product is good. Weight is also normal for a 6000 mAH battery. Camera quality is not as expected. Processor could be a bit improved. Ram management is absolutely fine. When it comes to battery life for heavy user it comes for 1 day and moderate user it comes around day and a half when data is completely on. I didn't observe any much difference with the Dolby Atmos option provided when headset or earphones plugged in. Worth buying the product at this price range from samsung.

Thanks to the Amazon team for thinking from the customer point of view and making it affordable to every common man.. Well done !"

It's important to solver this heating problem."
141170,refrigerator,Just don't expect very fast af from this one (which I did). The camera is a good one but the lenses make some noise while autofocusing and sometimes you'd prefer to use the manual focus. This 1500d is absolutely not for shooting videos. Picture quality is average. I bought it with the 50mm and it's okay. Anyways it's gud for beginners. Attached some pics I clicked of and a portrait of my friend.

147015,smartTv,No voice recognition. It‚Äôs not a real android TV. Half of the apps are age old. TV has too much Color‚Äôs and not enough controls to set it. Too bright for eyes. Wifi reception is not good. They should have given a FHD tv instead. Which could be converted to android tv using chromecast or amazon stick. Sound quality is cheap. Verdict- TV is not that smart.

The heating effect on charging could be seen on the first day, Picture quality is decent and works decently fine even in dim light.

149605,mobile,Overall good product for this price but the app and band numbers vary substantially if both are not connected during workout. Like if you run with band only then it will shoe 3mile run completed 500meters before in comparison to when you connect band with mobile app. The SO2 oxygen measurements is also fluctuating and can't say its reliable. App exercise workout schedule also states alot but don't function in the way they should to enable follow instructions. They should have a call centre for customer interaction on queries of they want to increase market share and are serious about product development.

With 70% signal strength on 2 SIM's, I still had issues with calls from within my home, as the person at the other end could not hear me at all.

136419,mobile accessories,I ordered in 2nd indian festival sale price shown is 9999. And also 1000 as Amazon pay balance and bank offer . So worth decided to buy for 8100. Suddenly i think of. I exchanged my old mobile asus zenfone for 1500. So totally i get this samsumg m 30 for 6600.ü§óü§ó I would say it is very worth more then a value for money phone. I ordered black colour looking very shiny and premium but slippery. Pros The screen is massive 6.4full hd led panel very bright very punchy. It has triple slot Does not bump in cameras like Chinese phones Massive 5000mah battery with 15v fast charger in box It is the same charger coming in samsung s10 Charging take nearly 2 hrs. No heating in charging. Even it has 5000mah battery it is very light in weight It come around 1.5 to 2days for average user The battery draining is very slow. Whole night with always on display it drains only5percent Important ly it has always on display Camera is doing pretty good for 6600price triple camera Front camera is good Its comes with one ui Samsung own ui its very smooth Cons The charger cable is short .. For heavy gamer i think i does not do it Finally my point it is very worth to buy for 6600 Thank amazon.

136802,mobile accessories,I saw many odd reviews abt the product before buying this. But it turned out to be good compared to the reviews . It actually depends on the need of an individual . The camera works very well rather the image quality is far better than the realme 5 pro . The low night images are bit noisy . The battery is moderate. Fingerprint sensor is bit slow . At this price point the in display sensor taking that time is okay in my opinion. The display as complained of not being fhd+ doesn't actually make such difference due to the amoled display. It turned out to be a good purchase as it fulfilled my needs that i actually wanted and accomplished my needs.

110809,mobile accessories,"A nice phone as per battery and display is. Concerned.Main drawback is that, in this phone we can use only one sim as 4G and another one will be 3G. So if you want to use internet, you cannot use it in the sim inserted in 3G slot. It will enable you to use internet in the 4G slim ONLY. Hence if you have internet in the sim inserted in 3G slot,then you have then you have to opt it as a 4G sim then only you can use the internet. The problem arises when you have one jio sim and another Airtel sim say for example, and if you want to use the internet in Airtel SIM then either you have to switch off the jio Sim and and make the Airtel sim as 4G in the settings provided or else you have to use jio sim only for internet which is the major drawback i feel"

147954,mobile,"Nothing to say about anything good except the display. Very bad build quality. The plastic back has some air pockets and it gives craking noise around the edges as well as on the back while holding the phone. You can't find such a cheap finish elsewhere. Bad cellular reception and very small earpiece. Weak audio signal over the headphone jack and speaker quality is abysmal. Dolby over the headphone is just a software tweak. It doesn't do any good. Hard to believe that it has a 6000 mah battery. Perhaps Samsung just named it regardless of the original capacity. Unless you experience this hands-on with some of the early victims' phones, please don't make the mistake that I had made by buying on the first sale."

160584,mobile,"This product is not of Samsung quality, gets hot (39 degree) even after taking just 2 pictures. And we can't get it replace as the allowed temperature set by Samsung 35 to 45 degrees so we can only complain above 45 degrees. It's kind of a user trap between Amazon and Samsung."
120139,smartTv,"Critical UPDATE PART 1 in my review - ok i have seen a flickering spot in the LED which is about a size of 6 - 8 inches and have called up the customer care who have immediately send a representative to my home and got the problem noted and given me 3 days to wait for the outcome as he has to send the complaint to his higher bosses , he has ensured me a replacement .... CRITICAL UPDATE CONTD PART 2 - The awesome Shinco team have given me a brand new full replacement for my 65 inches ..... HATS OFF TO SHINCO .... now i can say that plz buy this TV with zero tension and peace of mind ..... The 2019 cricket world cup with 4 k HDR at this price is a STEAL .... üòäüòäüòä I purchased the 65 inches model in the launch offer period for 49999 and i had a 50 inches Samsung led earlier, the tv is having a decent picture quality but if comparing to my 2013 model Samsung normal led i am confused as to what is the 4k fuss all about ? So the point here is u get what u pay for..... the picture quality difference is slightly noticeable between a proper branded expensive Tv like Samsung, lg etc ..... but again for this pricing u get a balance of a huge screen along with excellent picture quality in comparision to the giants of led tv.... and also the company is having a good installation team and packaging is also good .... ..... but again as i said it's a steal in this pricing .... as a 65 inches led in Samsung, lg would cost a bomb..... so it's a balance of both the world's bigger screen and an decent enough picture quality.... other advantages are the look of the tv is good and it's got a good interface with Wi-Fi and phone mirroring....also the 1 GB ram is not a big drawback because i have played heavy duty games after connecting with my ps4 and also have used the YouTube with my 50 mbps wifi connection and streamed movies from my Samsung note 8 without even a slight hint of noticable lag..... there was no lag issues at all ..... so all in all a good package , go for the 65 inches if u have a tight budget and need a bigger screen experience."

156950,mobile accessories,"The Samsung M30 comes with a 6.40 inch touchscreen display and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. This power packed device with a 5000 mAH supports fast charging and is powered by a 1.6 GHz octa-core Samsung Exynos 7904 processor that features 2 cores clicked at 1.8GHz and 6 cores clocked at 1.6Ghz and 4 GB RAM and 64 GB storage. This device runs on Android 8.1 Oreo and packs 3 rear cameras (13, 5 And 5 megapixel each) and a 16 megapixel front facing selfie camera for perfect selfie shots.

My phone usage is heavy, continuously using for several purposes and here is my honest review (I'm technical person so i know technical aspects) Display : Samsung rocks with AMOLED display, awesome. Performance : Super, if you manage your background apps and services, it will give more than enough performance. Camera : Really good (Far better than oppo/vivo/Mi and other brands, except iphone anyway), but clicks at night time or low light it may be average if object is moving and flash is off, for steady object it is good. Front & rear both have good output in both images & video recording. Body : Super smooth and color is too good (it is not my concern any way) Battery : Best battery performance I've ever seen in smartphones. On first day,100% to 0% drain with heavy and continue use took 1 day 3 hour 27 minutes till auto switch off, in super power saving mode enabled in settings (only call/sms) it may standby for 3 day minimum. Overall awesome phone with budget adjusting price, don't compare with RealMe XT as it doesn't have such battery & brand reputation."

165152,mobile,"Well 10 days I have been using this phone, I say its good, not great or amazing just good. Screen and battery are its main selling point. Amoled display and 6000 mah battery makes this phone look amazing, but its processor and 12 MP, not 48 MP sensor and plastic built are not up to its mark regarding the competition. Gaming is not great at all, I used to a play a game called crowd city and it doesn't run great. But ONE UI is amazing and one of the best I have ever used, I used MI UI and stock android, it's the best. If u just want good looking screen and do not play games, it's good for u. Battery optimization is not great I am a power user and i charge my phone daily and charging takes some time(2.5 hrs) to be precise from 0 to 100 %. Finally if u are going to drop your phone on a regular basis or accidentally I request not to buy this phone because amoled screen is very delicate and it doesn't work(screen damage) if it's dropped even from your pocket height and it costs 6k for the screen. The screen is gorilla glass 3, my phone got 2 little holes in screen, so if u buy before using buy a screen guard and hard case first."

This smart TV connects to YouTube or any site smoothly. No hickups in any aspect so far. I am writing this review after 15 days. I believe I won't be having any issue in future as well. The picture quality is awesome. Sound is loud enough. 1080p videos plays nice. Couldn't find ways to adjust brightness, contrast etc, but they have pre-set modes. Casting from mobile and laptop works perfectly. HDMI connection also works great. What else to say? A quality product at this price is a gift. I would definitely recommend this TV to anyone who is looking for a smart television."

114008,refrigerator,"Awesome camera below 1lakh. Since its the latest in the canon lineup it has all features for basic/mid level DSLR enthusiast. Once you master you can go for Canon 5D Mark IV that will be released in near furture. I my opinion its better to go for this instead of basic DSLR's and you can either keep it with you for long time incase if you dont want to update to any expensive camera or or you learn alot and then update. THis suits for both amateaurs and mid level professionals. Fir more pics please visit my facebook page ""Ramana photograhy"""

110644,mobile,A good phone with a great battery life. A rare smartphone whose battery lasts for about 2 days. Rear camera is ok but doesnt seems like 48mp. Low light performance may be improved. Front camera is good. Overall a must go phone if you are an avid gamer or frequent traveller as you would not have worry about charging your phone every now and then.

131410,smartTv,"Got it installed last evening and let me tell you all that I'm loving it. I am quite a picky once it comes down to gadget and I'm sure most of all are. It took me over one month of research to finally take my call. And I am proud that I have done a great job.cutting it short, jotting down pros and cons of this little giant. Pros: 1. It has to be the price tag. I have got the 40 inch one and this price is unmatchable. 2. Display. It's as good as many well known brand and that's for sure. You might not get it when you playing web contents on it but please don't judge it with a relatively slower internet connection most of us having. I don't have any dth connection as of now and I tried playing movies from my pen drive which were mostly Blu-ray quality and man it's a charm. The full hd panel is the best out in the market in this budget. You gonna absolutely love it. 2. No google playstore but you get all of them in inbuilt appstore. Youtube, netflix, prime come pre-installed. There was no sony liv in store but I got it from apkmirror and installing it was a breeze. 3.Sounddddddddd and it's huge. The 20w front speaker is big and really big. It'll comfortably do it's job in a big hallroom. 4.Installation process went so smoothly. The product delivered in a day and got installed on that day itself. Inst guy was good to say the least. 5. Excellent wifi reception and hotspot connection. Now cons though I found it negligible, 1. Just felt the remote could have a easier buttons on my fingers. It just felt a little bit clicky and hard. But as told earlier, it's easily negotiable. And that's it!!! Seriously loving it and I wish I just had some huge internet plan with insane speed. üòÅüòÅüòÅ. Verdict: But it. With closed eyes. Well done Shinco."

114282,mobile accessories,"Awesome phone and features, best in the segment features. üì∑ camera quality of the phone is very good.

I'll give fine start to the phone üì± only because of ""Kam me Bum"" Ali feeling....!!"
113250,smartTv,"At the price it seems ok. Picturr quality is ok, not great. But after using for sometime, scrolling this smart tv and selecting a program is very challenging. Not user friendly.

Mobile Heating- As of now I didn't find any heating up of mobile back ,but we can feel a little heat while charging and continuous watching of high quality YouTube videos. Charging - It supports fast charging and charges fast. Usually take 1 hour 20 mins from 10 to 100%. Photos & Videos : It has various modes in taking photos and videos including slow motion and themed photos. Images are very good from back camera .While front camera needs a bit of improvement. Videos are good and have stability. Overall it is worth for the price as sold by Amazon. I got this for 12000 after all the offers.Fast delivery by Amazon as they delivered in less than 24 hours (depends on your location) I recommend others to buy. Thanks Amazon !"

Superb display quality.. good sound quality.. Camera is good in daylight photography. It looks awesome.. fingerprint reader and face recognition is very fast.. Cons: UI is bad.. Asus zenUI is far better.. now iam using nova launcher.. touch response is not that much great when we drag the screen from upside.. front camera is 25mp but it looks like 8mp..Sound is litle less.

153561,mobile accessories,"SAMSUNG GALAXY M30 A Polycarbonate body reduces the effect of any heating and we get a very premium look with the GRADIENT affect. The built quality is VERY GOOD. The 6.4inch INFINITY U DISPLAY AMOLED SCREEN with FHD+ and 16M color support is a Cherry to the cake. With Type C for 3X fast charging with 15W inbox charger has been provided along with the 3.5mm Jack you can use any earphone of your choice. As soon as you get the phone you receive the ANDROID 9 and SAMSUNG ONE UI update (inbox Android 8) The Triple camera set up with 13MP main camera u can click great pics but not a very high end performance in low light and 5MP Wide angle camera gives you a 123¬∞ view which is another addition and the 5MP depth sensor is for crisp LIVE FOCUS pictures and the front camera of 16MP gives you crystal clear selfies. Battery of 5000mAh is Just HUGE and after a moderate use the battery lasts almost for 1¬Ω day and including gaming and excessive use also you can use it for a whole day which you don't get in other same budget phones. Fingerprint sensor is placed well and works quite well and unlocks the phone in less than a second ! The 4GB RAM and 64GB Internal memory and 1.8GHz Samsung Exynos 7904 octa core processor is apt for the phone and no serious lags or anything hasn't been found even after almost two months use. Games like PUBG and ASPHALT 9 run quite fine with no lags or frame drops. Gets heated after about 50-55min of gaming which is not much and very much acceptable I guess !? Dual sim + DEDICATED SD CARD SLOT for expending your memory to 512GB is another addition and just loved it ! A strong competitive phone launched by Samsung in this midrange. Quite apt if you have a budget of 15K, you get almost everything which you require. PROS : 1. GOOD BATTERY LIFE (5000mAh) OF A DAY OR MORE WITH 3X FAST CHARGING WITH TYPE-C 2. DEDICATED SD CARD SLOT 3. AMOLED FHD+ SCREEN WITH 16M COLOUR SUPPORT 4. TRIPLE CAMERA WITH ULTRA WIDE CAMERA ! 5. POLYCARBONATE BODY WITH PREMIUM AND ELEGANT LOOK !!! CONS : 1. HEATING AFTER HEAVY GAMING (not for Heavy gaming purposes) OF ABOUT 1HOUR (you shouldn't play games more than 1hour at a stretch :P) 2. The cable length is just 70cm and it's TOO SHORT ! 3. No other cons found as such Personal advice - YOU SHOULD GO FOR IT BECAUSE IT HAS THAT BRAND VALUE OF SAMSUNG AND THAT EXCELLENT SERVICE. *Doesn't contain earphones and cover."

133596,mobile,"I am a big fan of VIVO phones and was excited when I heard the company is launching their latest model, VIVO U10. The phone came with a price tag of Rs 9,990 for the 3GB, 64GB model which is good, but I was a bit apprehensive. My concern, how was the company expecting to squeeze all the features in a phone which is barely under 10k without comprising the quality. But as is the case with all the VIVO phones, there is no compromise and the U10 comes packed with a host of features. For one, the camera is really good and is perfect for a person like me who travels a lot and uses his mobile as a secondary camera. Comprising a triple rear camera which has a 13 mega pixel primary camera couples with a 8 MP front camera, the phone makes clicking pictures and selfies too a real pleasure. The phone boasts of a 6.35 inch HD display. The extra screen sure makes it fun watching Netflix movies and serials like Sacred Games and Bard of Blood on my phone. Other than that the phone and comes stocked with 5000mAh Lithium ion battery long with 18 W fast charging, which makes it a sure buy. Still there are a couple areas where I feel the company has let me down. Though I am really enjoying clicking pictures on my VIVO U10 but the company should have paid attention to the camera app which does not perform to its full potential when you are switching between different modes. Also, most of the time my phone is in my hand rather than my pocket or bag. But with VIVO U10 I feel a bit uncomfortable holding it in the hand as its edges are a bit pronounced. Anyways, these are minor irritants which should not bother you. The phone is very good looking, technologically advanced and stocked with the best of features. My Verdict is - buy it right away."

121767,mobile,"Everything is great and exactly as claimed just one thing I miss is Notification light. (Might be a point of concern for few) Camera quality is superb, specially Super Macro Mode and its Night mode do fab job. Screen is great and super responsive to feather touch Battery life is good with extreme fast charging (Wrap), noticeably faster than Dash Charging. Hope one glitch will be rectified in next update i.e. Some time it stays dumb- no sound or screen notification on receiving a whatsapp message or mail"

152860,mobile,Really a good phone to have. Pros: 1. 6000 mah battery and that too from Samsung is the best thing you could have for your phone. 2. 48+8+5 MP camera is a worth buy at this price. 3. Exynoz 9611 is a good processor at this range. Cons: 1. The processor is kind of battery consuming so you would be getting battery around 5700 mah. Other than that it's a best purchase.

137411,mobile,"I've been using this phone for a month now and I can rightly say that this is the best phone I've ever used. The processor is extremely fast and I can switch apps easily. Camera is also amazing even in night mode. Fingerprint reader is extremely fast. The only con I found is that battery could last longer. It lasts an entire day with average to heavy use but still OnePlus could have done better. Also, it lacks notification light."
132474,smartTv,"Great sound, battery life & build quality. Also very portable. Love it. Would recommend to stretch & go for this instead of any lesser brands from 2K & above range."

112917,mobile,"Apple iPhone X (Silver, 64GB) Apple is always known for their build quality and flawless software and the iPhone X is the epitome of their innovation. Have been using it for three weeks now and can safely say that this the best phone currently available in the market, with the Pixel XL a distant second. Pros: - the end to end retina display is absolutely amazing. Apple TrueTone display adjusts better than Android phones with changes in ambient light - software: iOS 11.2.5 is very user friendly and intuitive. My phone hasnt ever lagged or stuttered so far. - pretty good battery backup (easily lasting for an entire day on normal usage) - FaceID is a whole new ball game and apple wins it hands down. It is extremely accurate and easy to use and unlocks your phone as fast as fingerprint and even works in the dark. It is also secure as it checks if you are looking at the phone before performing a FaceID action. This is by far the best feature I felt on iPhone X and is a class apart from android phones. - the camera is really good in daylight and has a host of new features which includes portrait mode. Cons: - I personally dont like the notch at the top and makes the display look a little ugly. - Fast charger is not provided in the box. The charger provided takes very long (~1 hr 45 min) to charge the phone. - Earphones provided are not of the best quality. - Front camera is pretty average and doesnt take exceptional pictures under dim lighting conditions. That said, iPhone X is overpriced and is definitely not value for money. But if you are willing to shell off money to get the best phone in the market then this is what you should buy."

I was looking for a personal laptop which is both powerful and lightweight, and this one fits the bill pretty well. I upgraded the ram to 16 GB, so, now it runs in dual channel mode. Initially I had some issues with keyboard layout being messed up, but hopefully that got resolved, after a bit of googling. I've been using it for 2 weeks, and so far, don't have any complaints."

132771,smartTv,"Hai Everyone..! I am going to share my first i phone experience over here.Its going to be a bit lengthy so just relax and take a deep breath..!üòå Here we go..!üëç I received i phone 7 as a gift from my brother.Previously i was using an old android mobile so i am a newbie to the IOS world.Entirely IOS is different from a typical android OS..!üòá Now lets come to the product-: The package contains mobile,a head set,charger and a cable for connecting headset with the charging port.‚òù 1.Display-:‚úå It has a retina 4.7 inch HD display diagonal wide screen LED and it is very much convenient to carry in pockets and bags(My android mobile have 5.5 inch display).üëå It also has multi-touch display with IPS technology.üëç The screen resolution is 1334-by-750-pixel resolution which is so much good for video watching.üëç 2.Designing-:‚úå The metallic body gives a premium look just like old days.üëç I checked the water resistant capacity of this mobile and i can say blindly that its water proof(Accidently the mobile had fallen into my aquarium eventhough i dont have the courage to do so and there is no problem at all)üëç The finger print sensor works 100% perfectly.(I would say its far far better than android finger print sensor)üëç The weight of the mobile is just 138 gms.üëç 3.Camera-:‚úå The primary camera i just 12MP and secondary camera 7MP but i can feel the difference between android and iphone cameras.The pics have quiet good quality(May be better than android 16MP camera)üëç There is also digital zoom upto 5X.üëç There is autofocus,body and face recognition,Panorama and Timer.üëç Video recording is possible in 1080p with continious auto focus(Its not possible in my android mobile)üëç 4.Processor-:‚úå The procesor is A10 fusion chip with 64-bit architecture embedded M10 motion coprocessor and it works fantastically.üëç I played almost every mobile games in the itunes and every games runs smoothely.(No issues of game crashings)üëç Battery-: If there is only normal usage then it is gonna lasts for 1 day.ü§ï Sound-: The headset and the mobile speakers have decent sound quality.(Not a hardcore experience for me)üòí Negatives-: 1.The battery drains so fast if i play online games.üëé 2.Sometimes it is inconvenient to connect the intermediate cable between headset and the charging port.üëé 3.Whenever i press the home button i feels that the entire bottom portion of the mobile is clicking along with it(Personal opinion)üëé Verdict-: If you are planning to make a diversion from android mobile to IOS then you may find it difficult to use it initally.Once you started to use it,you will be amazed..!üòá If you are an iphone user,then i dont need to say anything..!You know your choice..!üòí Thats all i wanna share..!üòá üëâThanks 4 reading..!üëà"

118750,mobile,By far the Best product of Samsung You don't need a go pro to capture wide angle images. This provides the best result. Battery life is fantastic. Got the phone day before yesterday charged fully and the phone is still going strong. Display is amazing. At 6000 Mah battery the weight of the phone is just perfect. 6 GB RAM 128 GB ROM with this price is a cracking deal. I recommend this phone to every body who loves photography on the phone.
132926,mobile,Has restarted on its own several times now. Laggy and slow UI. Best battery life. Video playback is not smooth. Too much Samsung bloatware. Not recommended. Amazon Support does not help in replacing or returning the item. They will ask you to install Blancco app and check if anything is wrong. Restarting problem will not be shown in the app. Not the kind of service expected from Amazon. Please do not buy again.

157665,smartTv,The iPhone 7...obviously amazing..super cute..rose pink
119549,mobile,"Camera takes a bit of time to focus, which makes pictures on the go, get blurred sometimes. However the picture quality is very good. The wide angle helps in getting most of the area captured. The battery lasts for a day and half, although I am not a heavy user. Ideally for me it should last for two days. My earlier Samsung A8+ battery lasts for a day even after one and half years. Overall I am very happy with the product."
125124,mobile,Good
153636,mobile,"Samsung Galaxy M30S is a overall good mobile under 17k but the camera quality is below average. I gave it one star coz there is no option for 0 star in review. I would like to request Samsung that the company should be honest while advertising the product. The monster camera is just the name, camera quality is really bad like a 8 megapixel camera, photo are blurry and has a lot noise in the pictures. If anyone want a camera mobile then the A series in Samsung is way better then this or you can go for vivo z1x or realme xt etc. I'm not happy with this purchase coz camera is a mandatory part of mobile and I'm disappointed with this phone in camera quality."

110180,mobile accessories,"1. I am facing minor issues for the screen touch sensitivity. Sometimes it doesn't read the touch even after multiple tries. 2. The fingerprint reader is a bit at slower end. 3. The face unlock feature is also not full proof and sometimes I have to try 2-3 times. 4. The Android one system does not have a App duplication feature, so that's another hit 5. Complete transfer of data from old phone becomes difficult as there is no app like ""One Plus Switch"" available for this work. So had to use some third party app. Other than these issues, the phone is working fine. Camera is great, battery life is pretty decent, works smooth with it's 6gb ram and processor."

137012,refrigerator,"I want this review be helpful for someone who is making a decision for his first DSLR. One sentence review is, buy this if you value photo image quality above everything else. Obviously if you are looking at D5300, you will have the following cameras in your consideration. Nikon D3300, D5200, D5500, Canon 600-750D. Let me tell you that if you just want pictures to be taken in auto mode and do not want to tinker much, then you can choose any of these cameras they are all fine. But if you want to eke out the last drop of performance, there is nothing better than D5300 in cost/performance right now. Why ? It is the best APSC image sensor in the market that can challenge a D800 (per Ming Thein). Some Cons: 1. No built-in motor. (Not a big deal, most lenses are AF-S anyways) 2. Average Live-view and remote shooting abilities. 3. Typical Nikon video control limitations. While Canon is busy repackaging their 2009 sensor in incremental updates, the Sony sensor in D5300 is top of its class. By the way, the straight out of camera pictures of D5300 is as good as canon, a weak point for al Nikon cameras before this generation. So the only place it lacks is pro level video capabilities that Magic Lantern can unlock for Canon cameras. If you need responsive live-view, video controls, skip Nikons. Canon is a better wholesome package. For image quality that is best in the industry D5300 is as good as it gets. Against other Nikons: D5200 > While pretty good, I consider the D5300 a worthwhile upgrade. D3300 > Cheap D5300 with missing features, buy if you cannot afford D5300. D5500 > D5300 + Touch Screen without GPS By the way, buy with 18-140mm and not any other bundle, you will thank yourself later. Of course, buy the 35mm 1.8."

Actually complete remote works for 43"" Pictures quality is mutch better than expectation. Sound is also gud.. But I faced an issue, USB takes too much time to processing..net connectivity is very gud.. Smart feature like YouTube Netflix hotstar any many more applications are also good.. Finally I suggest to buy it without any doubts...go for Kevin smarty TV üëç.."

But I don't think it's of 10000mah, battery capacity of my phone is 2730mah, but this power bank charges my phone for 1 and half time only. The power bank discharges automatically. It doesnt worth the price. Lenovo power banks are far better that this. Requesting you guys not to buy this."

150564,mobile accessories,Phone is good. Battery life is awesome. Full day battery.. phone is slim and weight less. good to use. Gorilla glass 5 in back is gives a good look. Camera quality is good. drawbacks. Fingerprint reader is little bit slow. Slow response. Display is not full hd. Because of that display brightness is low.
165006,mobile,Waste of buying this mobile... Totally waste. No worth of buying this mobile.. it is equal to 3000 rupees worth.
160299,mobile accessories,This phone is amazing the display is very nice and the battery backup is also gud for a user like me who don't play games and rather uses much for social media and office purpose ...believe me this is the best phone at this cost
137074,refrigerator,"I was fed up with the amount of dust that the sensor of my Nikon D7100 was picking up and the number of times I was having to get it cleaned so was torn between getting shot of all my gear and moving to Canon, upgrading to the D7200 or looking at what was new to market. The D5600 had just been released and on paper looked amazing, so I decided to 'downgrade' to what is classed as a beginners camera. The camera was poorly packed by Amazon in a box that had a bare minimum of those air filled bags around it, so was rattling around inside the box and on opening it up it was obvious that the camera had been unpacked and packed back in the box again at sometime as the battery wasn't even in any plastic packing or where it should have been in the box. Like other buyers the camera came with a Europe two pin plug charger and no instruction book, but I took my first photo and loaded the photo into Picasa to view he shutter count and it showed a count of 1, so even though it looked as if the camera had been handled no pics had been taken before I took mine. I've purchased a genuine Nikon three pin charger plug for ¬£20 and have downloaded a PDF of the manual from the Nikon website to make my purchase complete. Now for the positives, this camera is so light, the lightest SLR I've ever owned, it's lighter than some mobile phones I've owned, well balanced in my hand and had a good sized grip, I'm over 6ft so have very big hands and it doesn't feel like a toy at all. Having owned several Nikon DSLRs the controls and handling is natural, nothing new to get my head around, the LCD is large and clear, and covers lots of angles so I can shoot over crowds. The main selling feature of this camera is Snapbridge, once it's set up on your phone it really does work, Nikon have tried it with adaptors in the past that were hit and miss but they've nailed it this time, I shot with the camera and the photos are on my phone and I can post straight to Instagram, my Instagram followers must wonder what's going on! The 18-55 VR lens with the kit is turning out some crystal clear images and like the camera is amazingly light, focusing is quick and sharp. I've only had the camera for a week, but so far so good, let's hope I don't see the same sensor dust problems that the D7100 suffered with."
162497,mobile,"Very bad experience, mobile automatically gets switched off! After visiting service center found liquid damage but there's new thing is it's getting charged normal."

136345,refrigerator,"I moved from smart band to smart watch, and indeed it is worth and proves to be right move. This watch is much faster (due to power processor and higher memory), bigger and clearer display, more accurate and easier to use. Functioning well and touch, color, display are awesome including user friendliness. I tested it including swimming, sleeping and it works well. Got two updates and installed successfully with no hassle. Having it's own GPS, is an added advantage to provide the accurate information and tracking. I only wish that it should have: a) More watch faces (especially clear with large font and not cluttered) to be available. b) Adaptive screen brightness (based on the light sensing) I recommended it. I got in a good deal during festive offer. Happy so far"

153681,mobile,"Samsung M30S is a beast when it comes to battery power, processing, speed and storage space. I got it just on the launch date. The Opal Black color looks very premium and the phone is aesthetically pleasing. It has been over a week and I have been using the phone without any issues. Clicked many photos and they are simply astounding. Photos clicked outdoors have great colors captured. Photos in Night mode are also good but with visible grains. Games like Call Of Duty & Pubg run smoothly without any lag and heating. The fingerprint scanner and face-unlock are quick. The OneUI is clutter-free and smooth and you also have the option to disable any Ads that might show in the notifications. The Power Mode and dark mode extends the battery juice and it lasts for one and a half-day on a single charge but I wish Samsung had provided with a 25W charger instead of 15W, as the phone takes 2 hours to get to 100% . I can recommend this phone to anyone though, as it has the latest specs, which should last long enough."

115356,mobile accessories,Battery Low capacity
160695,mobile,"This review is mainly for the people who are buying this for 6000mah battery and a 48mp camera. I had a Redmi 3S Prime which had a 4000mah battery with 5 inch screen at 720p resolution which lasted for around 1.5 - 2 days when it was new. This one has a 6000mah battery with 6.4 inch screen at FHD+ resolution, faster processor, higher resolution camera and far more sensors than the 3s. So it won't last as good as the Redmi 3s Prime. The phone will last for 1-1.5 days depending on the usage. Camera quality is just about average but with some good features. Almost all the phones of Samsung have SuperAMOLED display these days so that's also a plus point. 6000mah battery is a necessity in phones with above 6inch screen(FHD+). One UI is not as feature rich as MIUI but has better quality than MIUI. People are easily misleaded by the self proclaimed 'GYAANIs' on youtube these days."

114793,refrigerator,Awesome watch for buisnesmans & health conscious people.
111094,refrigerator,Absolutely great... Authentic watch design feels great in hand... Bright display... Stacked to the brim with all features... The only disappointment is that Samsung pay isn't supported by s3 gear in India... Waiting for the update that rectifies that... Since my mobile is also a Samsung made i had full compatibility without any issues... Other stock Android devices from other company might not benefit completely by this watch... But if you have a Samsung mobile then do go for it... I got it during the sale for 18k... Which is worth every penny... Update: interface look absolutely great after the update to One UI i.e Tizen 4.0.0.4... interactive speed has also increased and the OS version is the same as the latest galaxy watch. One more reason to go for this rather than the latest galaxy watch.... Kudos to Samsung for backing up this old watch with latest updates... Just go for it

The phone has a beautiful display and it's also quite handy to work with . Well probably everyone would have talked about the battery , I will reiterate the same. It reminds me about the battery life of old nokia phones. It's that good. I think they can improve in the camera dept. a bit .. The phone's thickness is a bit on the higher side but the weight is not noticeable despite the 6000mAh battery. It's a good all rounded phone for people with screen display and battery life as their highest priority."

113303,refrigerator,Attracted by the Gear S3's design and advertised features I bought this gadget in Mar-17. I am a walking and cycling enthusiast. Everything was fine till about 10 months. Subsequently I started facing problems. I now understand Gear S3 is not SWEAT RESISTANT. SWEAT has entered into the gadget and watch got badly damaged. Now I am asked to shell out about Rs.9K for servicing the Gear S3. Samsung now smartly downplays the water resistant feature of the gadget by responding to me as Gear S3 is NOT WATER PROOF. Guys out there who would like to use Gear S3 as fitness gadget be aware Gear S3 IS NOT A WORTHY WEARABLE TO BE USED AS A FITNESS GADGET. Don't feel feel bad after having paid Rs.28500 and the gadget stops functioning due to body sweat entering the gadget if used for fitness monitoring.

166540,books,Worth reading!!!! I like it
153518,mobile accessories,Reviews got me really worried that the text on the screen was going to be pixalated. But on seeing it for myself i can say that text is only going to be pixalated if you bring the device unreasonably close to your eyes. The other reason to not buy this phone was the slower processor but as Asus M3 pro has not yet launched and Mi decided better cameras were what people will want and not faster processor and as i am a sucker for stock android this is the one i bought.
117232,mobile,Best low budget phone i have ever used and nice display nice sound soft touches and nice colors nice handling nice processing and good speed and specifications .Thanks Amazon and Samsung for the wonderful service and product I got phone in 2 days with Amazon delivery and a safe package

135118,smartTv,"I have been using JBL Flip since the first version appeared in the market, and it was given to me by Microsoft as gift. I didn't know what would I do with it. I chose this as option when I had eliminated all other options as gift I wanted. Little did I know it would be so useful in daily life, that whole of my family used it. I thought who would connect this by bluetooth and why would anyone use such a small speaker. I dare say, Flip (the first one) sounded only slightly lesser, but strongly comparable to Bose (albeit slightly less). What extra could be done in a small loudspeaker, I asked myself. 7 years passed on. I bought (this time with my own money) as a gift for wife, the Flip 4. The bass here is awesome, and they have added a functionality of JBL Connect+, where a similar speaker can be connected to this one, and they can be played. JBL claims a 100 Flips can be connected together, so I am guessing they have some protocol of their own, and they can be played simultaneously for probably some party. Another noteworthy feature is Waterproofing: this one is waterproof and which is a big deal for us, as we are constantly on run, and we need the loudspeaker for demo purposes. Being waterproof, I am hoping this will also be dust proof too. Next is the design: This one is far more bulkier than Flip, or Flip 3 SE (I own both), and a slight bit heavier too, but it is still ok for carrying around. The colour Red is pretty, and I think it can be used by men and women alike. Lastly, the battery is really awesome. I received it at around 12 PM, and it's continuously on, playing things as they are coming (it's 10 PM right now). I haven't charged it yet, so I would be unable to comment on the time it takes to charge fully. Charging: Flip (original one) had coaxial socket for charging, which they have replaced here for micro USB for good. The Cons: The sides have vibrating discs attached, which shake when it plays music. Given that it is instructed to refrain from touching it, I understand it is the Achilles' Heel of this Hercules. Why would someone introduce a weak spot in otherwise such fine product is beyond my design sensibilities, but I'm no artist, only a mere science scholar. The exterior is made of nylon, which may turn dirty, but looks beautiful and pristine. I hope it remains as such. The treble is the weak area. In order to add the bass, they have compromised on treble. What this review doesn't have: I am yet to download the JBL app and see what it offers."

166789,mobile,"Writing this after 2 weeks of usage. Cons It doesn't have sensor to sense light. Uses camera instead of that. So, it takes time to get the mobile locked when we are in call and getting the mobile closer to ear. Adaptive brightness also facing same issue. Taking more time for charging. Pros Battery life is excellent. Camera is good. Charger cable is short. It will help us to avoid using mobile when it is charging. Don't buy a lenghty cable üòä Its my bestie's gift.

129535,mobile,Good product
146175,mobile,"Nice product from Samsung. Excellent for normal usage and casual gaming. Rear cameras are also good.The best part is the battery backup. And most importantly, it is SAMSUNG - Manufactured in INDIA. Pros: 1) Battery: You can easily get a screen on time of 11-12 hours which translates to 2-2.5 days for practical daily use. It takes 2 hrs and 30 min to fully charge from 0 to 100, which is good considering the monster 6000mah battery of this phone. 2) Display: Just one word - awesome... Samsung super amoled displays are the best. Period. 3) Very low SAR value 4) Crisp and clear call quality and earpiece. 5) One Ui interface is simple and full of useful features. The Night mode is simply amazing. 6) Rear cameras: Good rear cameras. Pictures have natural colors and have enough detail. The 48 mp mode is also great. The wide angle lens is also excellent in this range. Super steady mode in video recording is also pleasing. Slow mo videos are also quite good. 7) Device ergonomics are on point. 8) Decent processor for daily usage, multitasking, and casual gaming. The only issue is: > Selfie (front) camera: Images are a bit soft and lack detailing. Hope this improves via a OTA update."

133274,smartTv,"Hi, I am a big fan of Xiomi products. They always worked perfactly. But i am not happy with my recent purchase of Mi 4C pro TV. The TV is good but there is so much to improve in software part. 1. There is no auto AV select on boot option. There are older members in our family and they are not able to handle new OS like interface and they just want to watch good old Set Top Box Channels. It was a simple option in previous version of MI TV 4A so why it is not available in this one? Temporary Solution :- You can select Live TV app in TV and set it as the first app in home screen. So whenever you tv starts it will be the first app selected by default and by pressing select (big middle round button) Set Top Box will start. 2. There is no instant TV on option. It is available in other same category android tv. After shutting down we have to wait for the whole OS to load again. 3. I bought MI IR cable and it is detected by Live TV Guide app in main screen but whenever i select a channel it says the cable is not connected. I have tried resetting the TV and still not working. It was working fine in previous tv why is it not working in this one. Please help. 3. Why can't i use the built in bluetooth as a regular normal bluetooth like sending files and more. When android is available there in tv and we are paying for it why not let us use it at its full potential. 4. It's a android TV and no time is displayed on home screen. I have always liked Mi for its full support for the customers. I hope they will come up with solutions and release an update as soon as possible."

132713,smartTv,"Guys, do not buy this TV. It says its a smart TV but doesn't support some of the most common apps like Amazon Prime video. You would be required to shelve 3k-4k more to get some streaming device."
157524,smartTv,"The device worked fine initially for 7-10 days. Then started connectivity issues. Sometimes, Alexa itself says I am not connected to internet while system shows all ok. When contacted customer care, problem remained unsolved. Rest is nice. Sound quality is good."

141023,mobile accessories,JBL headphones are always best. I bought it for the third time from Amazon and every time it was a great deal.
161142,mobile,Touch is smooth. Overall look and finish of the phone is very nice. Only thing which bothers is the camera quality which is really downgrade and u get blurry images as if they were taken from a decade old camera phone.
157425,mobile,The camera quality is superb. The battery is ok. I charge my mobile once in a day. The sound quality is ok. No Dolby sound. Overall performance is satisfactory. MI remote is not working properly. There are few bugs. I guess it will be sorted our with the new update.
165902,mobile,Works great
131179,smartTv,Good.
137589,smartTv,If you are looking for an entry level gaming laptop then you should go for it. You can run mostly all of the new AAA titles easily at decent fps. For better gaming performance you should connect the charger and turn on turboboost option. Now you can enjoy your game. Battery is average. You can get upto 4.30-5 hrs of backup at normal working. But for a gaming laptop that backup time is also enough. So you can go for this laptop if your budget is not that enough for buying ROG or OMEN etc.
139523,refrigerator,It's an awesome for beginners

157230,mobile,"The best smartphone in this price range. Samsumg has unbeatable screen and i am loving it. All the features are up to the mark. Screen, camera and battery life are the best features of the phone. The phone does not feel heavy or too large. I will recommend the pearl white color because white looks most ""classy"". It certainly gives you the premium feel when you use it. Only competitor of this phone right now is realme XT but first it is more costly and secondly it is a new brand which is constantly competing with its own phones with every phone new month. You will not fell like having a new phone after another release which a felt with my old xiomi. Above all Samsung branding does gives the phone a mid range look like realme and xiomi. The only flaw which i feel is the UI which is good but not like the stock android. Some features of samusung ONE UI are not well developed or optimized but also some features are great also. But is like the same with other competetors also so no option."

118430,smartTv,"Bought this TV during the festive offer. TV was delivered within 2 days. Kevin customer care was closed due to Diwali holidays. Installation person came after 4 days. He was a newbie and did not know most of the things. He kept calling someone one phone for guidance. After 3-4 hours of struggling he declared the TV was unable to connect to Wifi as there is a Software or Motherboard problem. I had to struggle with Amazon for a week with over 20+ calls to get it refunded. 2/5 points for Amazon in handling this case so badly. The technician Amazon appointed to verify the TV condition from Qdigi - who did not turn up and wasted our time - gets 0/5 Worst service from Qdigi. The 2nd technician appointed from Amazon - Vcare - gets 5/5 for a prompt service who confirmed that the TV is faulty. Coming to the review of the TV during my 10 days use - The picture quality is just ok ok.. Having used Sony 49 inch 4k TV and a VU Full hd 32 inch tv, I felt the VU quality better than the KEvin quality. Sony picture quality is way better than both. The sound quality on the Kevin was really bad.. The speakers on the VU 32 inch is much better. The onscreen menu and interface is also badly designed by Kevin. All the hdmi ports and usb ports are at the bottom, behind the Tv, which makes it difficult to reach. The remote is also confusing to use. Overall I could compare to the VU and Sony that we had, and the KEvin was nowhere a good TV. I'm glad we received a faulty TV and could return it. Waste of our time and effort."
147199,mobile,Not a great sound for this price. I expected better. I have another earphone in the same price segment with a different brand which is much better than this. This kind of quality is available in 200-300 INR easily. Don't waste your money buying this.
116013,mobile accessories,"Battery life not as expected disappointment where i needed a long lasting battery life (maybe a problem with my piece) , camera and display are more than good , fingerprint scanner is not so bad afterall. Onscreen fingerprint (optical ones) compared to oneplus 6T of one of my friend performs equally ! What more to expect, buy phones with rear or physical fingerprint scanner if you need a speedy unlock. Moreover face unlock is pretty good but less secure !"

116549,mobile,Best 11k phone trust me on that how ever I will recommend putting an SD card for more storage
118298,mobile,Both WiFi and Hotspot issue is there. Battery life is very bad Go for Android
118787,mobile,Cable quality is good but connectors quality is very bad. Excellent customer service from boat. They replaced my product twice.
138221,smartTv,It did not work. My friend ordered JBL 2 months back and the battery is already not working well.
143143,mobile,"Moved from andriod to ios. Very disappointed on the flexibility of use compared to andriod. Very rigid set of controls. not much options to play around like andrioid apps. moreover, you cannot move whatsapp and truecaller data to ios. you have to loose all that data. truecaller doesn't show caller id. photos are native format and need a 3rd party utility to convert to jpg. apple / google keyboard doesnt show any alpha numeric layout. you have to switch layout. no autosave passwords for websites you visit in Chrome. i think due to battery, very heavy. pretty unimpressive and not happy. last but not the least, No Amazon UPI on iOS - very funny and silly phone that is sold by Amazon itself - that's amazing Apple - the worlds costliest least worthy phone sold by Amazon"
137153,mobile accessories,"I was using a flagship phone before this so my review is bit biased. Average in-screen finger print reader considering the feature works slower than actual hardware finger print scanner. Please don't consider 48MP camera clicks better than 24MP one plus camera, although AI camera helps but still image stabilization is not that great. Android one is the only reason I went for this phone. High end specs and android one at this price, I consider it good value for money."
155398,smartTv,"Such a great phone. I'm loving it. Black looks elegant and smooth. Im new to iOS and its damn cool. ----------------------------------------- The above feedback was after 3 days of use. This is my 8th days with iPhone 7 and guess what, my iPhone 7 doesn't get unlock. Touch id hangs and doesn't respond. passcode doesn't work. I can just watch my home screen and play with live photo screen saver.....Got an appointment with the service center and not sure whats going to happen (fingers crossed). This is my first apple product and my experience sucks. Paying 70K for a phone and this kind of experience make you rethink of all the negative feedbacks i had seen which Amazon deleted purposefully. I'm not sure whether this is a hardware problem or software problem but i feel terrible for switching to iPhone."
147595,mobile,Not satisfied battery was draining within 9 hrs and taking 3 hrs to be filled. Camera was a big cheat. Processor is cool. Speakers are like drum box no clarity at all. Not suggestible.

132143,mobile,Great phone rather than buying it online get it it at a premium apple store atleast you will be sure you won‚Äôt be getting any defective phones rather than purchasing it online blindly
112711,mobile,"Amazon service was very gud, within 3 days I got mobile. I check Samsung Galaxy M30s in flipkart, snapdeal etc.. but Samsung Galaxy M30s was not displayed... Amazon only displayed Samsung Galaxy M30s... Now also i checked mobile out of stock in flipkart.. Samsung Galaxy M30s is gud product.. Like camera, battery, features, everything is gud.. I used SBI debit card so, I got 10% discount for the product.. Some disadvantages mobile some time heat.."
153741,mobile accessories,"Samsung have once again focused on battery capacity as one of the highlights. The Galaxy M30s has a 6,000 mAh battery under the hood, the biggest I‚Äôve ever seen on any Galaxy phone, no matter which price segment it may fall in. The other notable feature on the M30s is a 48MP primary rear camera. That‚Äôs nearly a 5x increase in the megapixel count over the M30 and higher than even the Galaxy A70. The Galaxy M30s comes with the Exynos 9611 chipset, which seems to be the same as the Galaxy A50‚Äôs Exynos 9610. The M30s also gets a design update, mainly in the way the rear cameras and flash module are placed. There‚Äôs a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED Infinity-U display, 5MP and 8MP depth and ultra-wide rear cameras, a 16MP front camera, 15W fast charging, and a physical rear-facing fingerprint sensor."

Love love these JBL babies !!"
156040,mobile,Superb
138538,mobile,"It is an excellent phone but there is some issues with it also. Like it heats up sometimes, camera stopped responding sometime. When you are using camera to take pictures it freezes or blank screen appears and when you try to reopen the camera, it doesn't not open. I think there is some software issues with camera function. One pus must really acknowledge this issue as it is the only measure issue with this phone."
126296,mobile,Good
158191,mobile accessories,The phone just fell 2 feet from the table and entire front and back glass broke. That too I referred my friend to buy the same model..what good is it. If he cracks both front and back ..with all that technology in it .Amazon nor can the service centre will replace or do it free of cost. I totally understand if I drop it at a good hight..but 2feet is bull crap!...not worth buying an indian made product!...it's a shame!

164099,mobile,Very nice cell. 6000mAh battery and c type charge with fast charger. It Can be used for 2 days without charging. Camera is awesome . Night mode of camera is very good . Also video stabilization feature is very nice. No lag while playing heavy games like pubg and call of duty. I recommend this mobile who want better battery back up. Fingerprint reader is also fast. Also face recognizing feature is much faster.

160753,smartTv,"This was my first experience with mac. I needed a laptop which doesn't need too much attention and is fast and sleek. I had always used windows laptops and Pcs in the past, but had heard of the macs being very fast and user friendly. Also I needed it to use Final Cut Pro which is fastest video editing tool. So I made the decision to move to mac and buy the cheapest in the lot, I had read lots of reviews and had seen unboxing and review videos, all of them complained about the poor display quality, as the lcd panel is 720p only and all of them wanted a 4K display. Still i chose to buy Mac book air, as I had in the past used 720ps laptops and display wasn't a priority to me. After having used this for past few months, I got used to the New mac OS, took me few google searches to understand it. but its damn convenient to use. Some of the impressive parts I have listed below. Battery seems to last for ever. There is no Visible air vent, and speaker vent (I was surprised how does it work and where the sound was coming from) Touch pad is so good that it feels better than a mobile's touch screen. The charger is so Small you won't believe it. (many laptops come with a bulky charger) The way power adapter connects to the Mac with magnetic strip gives a futuristic feel. The mac is so meticulously built and designed that you will love its every curve.(I don't want to romanticise about it but you could fall for it) And above all the MacOS is so good, that the jittery feel of random softwares and drivers missing in windows will not bother you here. #3 words to summarise it ALL Fluid Fast & Beautiful"
120784,mobile,Displayed as 10000 MAH it's barely 6000 MAH. Discharged very fast gets charged very slowly.

You have to keep juggling your mic, so that other person can hear you. The mic captures more noise from outside and I guess it doesn't do noise cancellation properly at all. I do not have a choice to return it after 2 months of use."

153341,mobile accessories,"Redmi 6 Pro is a very nice android device. With 4000 mAH lasts for two days as is claimed and is recharged fast with its charger . It has its own system of checking security including payment securities. Display of 5.84"" is good enough. Display resolution of 2280 x 1080 is nice. However, the width should have been more broad for ease of viewing, writing and navigating. It has its good number of useful apps pre-installed that average users may not have to install third party apps like photo editing, notes, cloud storage, scanner, cleaner, compass, torch, etc. Cleaning app regularly checks and suggests cleaning of junk files, memory. Fingerprint lock and AI system is added security. System and security updates are available at regular intervals. The body is strong and solid. With dual rear camera the picture quality is very good even in low light conditions. Networking is good enough depending on the strength of available network providers. Sound quality is nice. The file manager is not convenient. The message management system is also cumbersome. Safety locking from accidental deletion of important messages is lacking. On the whole a nice buy."

121289,mobile,Easy to carry. Led light indicator easily displays whether it's charging properly or not. Affordable price. But the usb connector is problematic. It doesn't get easily attached to mobile or other devices. It needs a lot of pressure to be pulled out of the devices.

The battery however is a BEAST, I always used to carry my power bank along with me for the iPhone 7 but i no longer need to with the XR, easily gives me an entire day of use with more than 6hr SOT and still have about 25-30% juice left! Looking forward to what ios13 brings..."

I am writing this review one year after purchasing it and it works like a charm. Still. I don‚Äôt feel the need to upgrade to some other device (iphone 8, x or xs) because it works flawlessly without any lag or delay whatsoever. The camera is great. The only problem is the battery life which isn‚Äôt enough for a complete day."

We did not expect this quality from reputed manufacturer like HP. We are disappointed. After submitting this response on 3rd July, not a single response from HP. This shows their careless attitude for defective model. I used to always buy HP product for personal use and official use. This attitude will change my mind and will not take HP at face value. Again disappointed."

116957,mobile,Best display. Battery is 6000mah but it drains fast. So you can expect the battery backup of 1 day with heavy usage. Finger print sensor is ok. But Not the fastest. Rear Camera quality is good but not you can not compare it with Sony's imx sensor which comes in one plus 7. So camera is okay but 48mp shooter is just for the namesake. It works like same old samsung a50 camera. Ui is very nice.

However this phone is not friendly with MI. It does not have an option to log in using MI account. Also it does not have a Gallery but is connected to Google Photos app. It does not have the security scan and clear cache options.

I asked about today's news and it has the same answer - Sorry, I don't know about what you are asking. OK Google is far far far better than Alexa. Wanna share one funny moment with Alexa...

137103,books,"I was looking through some of the reviews and see that some people gave it five stars and some gave it only one. I think if the people who gave it one star would practice the principles given in this book they would quickly upgrade their rating. This book was published in 1937, during the Great Depression, and if the people who suffered during that time had read this book their lives might have been better. It is really about convincing yourself to become wealthy. It outlines the steps you need to take and the steps you need to avoid. There are also a lot of interesting ideas in this book. For example, sex transmutation is where you transfer the energy of your libido into other purposes. Great people have done this. Also, 99% of the public has no goal in life that is why they are stuck in jobs they do not want. Most people do not succeed until they are older. In fact, most success does not come until after you are 40 years old. Edison & Carnegie were past the age of 40 when they made their fortune. He forgot to mention that George Washington was 43 when he took on the greatest military on earth. His roundtable idea is very intriguing. I do not see why anyone would not want to read this book."

These devices with the A12 bionic chip just beat any other android devices in graphics rendering performance without a doubt. People have been complaining about the display that is basically 828p but trust me, you won‚Äôt even notice the difference between a proper 1080p screen and this one. In fact this screen looks better than most of the 1080p mobile phone screens (thanks to the liquid retina display technology it uses). The camera is amazing in all aspects and one of the best out there in the smartphone market but it can‚Äôt click portraits without detecting a human face (P.S. you can download an app named halide at the appstore to click non human portraits)."

The screen feels premium due to the super AMOLED display. Combination of black with green contrast was very good. Overall the phone is good and can be purchased without hesitation. Price offering by amazon and Samsung was also very reasonable, considering the bank and wallet offers :)"

138907,mobile,"It looks awesome, slim aluminum body with matte colour gives it beautiful finishing. Performance wise it's not a 10000 mAh power bank, as I've tested, so it should be 6000 - 7000 mAh power bank. One more important thing, it haven't any fast charging feature, it takes more time than regular charger ie. it takes more than 04:00 hrs to charge 3000mAh battery; which normally takes 2 0r 2 and half hrs for 0 to 100% charging."

156861,smartTv,"The Good: The iPhone 7 has the biggest key features anyone want: a fast processor, water resistance, a more durable solid-state home button, and still really good cameras with rear optical image stabilization. iOS 12 is help this phone to perform even better than on iOS 11. The Bad: Lacks the extra speed and improved camera quality of the iPhone 8. No fancy Face ID or other iPhone X-type designs. No headphone jack (an adapter comes in the box). No wireless charging. The Bottom Line: The gap between iPhone 8 and iPhone 7 isn‚Äôt as great as I think, and for the right price, this is still an excellent pick if you‚Äôre not chasing the latest bleeding-edge iPhone and want to save some money."

By far I found over all quality excellent Dispaly and touch quality also very good. Battery still performing very but long run evaluations are required for proper feedbacks. I found little heating issue when I updated app from google, now days it's not arising Over all quality of the handset is good. Till now it's performing above expectations. My earlier mobile was MIA1 & that has a heating problem, if u talk it will be heated up in no time. But M30s doesn't have such problems. I found my choices far better than MiA1. More over after exchange and other discounts I purchase it around 12k. And I found it's over all quality is best far better than other manufacturers."

166387,mobile,"Worth every penny just for the camera! The camera on this device is of premium quality and even better than some flagships. Most smartphones fail in low light, but Mi A2 outperforms every device in this price segment even in badly lit conditions. Not to forget, ANDROID ONE means clutter free stock Android experience and the promise of regular updates for atleast 2 years! Simple and super intuitive. Won't be the usual mi device with many annoying applications. Nice to see that it's a TYPE C charging port. To be honest, this is not an overall product. 3010 Mah battery is quite average. No 3.5mm headphone jack. But mind you, the type-c converter is provided. Bear in mind, you cannot listen to songs and charge your device simultaneously unless you have Bluetooth earphones. This might be deal breaker for many. Yes. NO SD CARD slot. Just dual sim. But I still love this device for the camera. If you love clicking pictures, and wouldn't mind an average battery, lack of headphone jack, and no expandable storage, then go for it!"
158694,mobile,The rear camera is protruded from the body and has a chance that it may get damaged while putting these on table. Need proper protection

124201,mobile accessories,"First of all, those people who have given the 1 and 2 star reviews either don't know how to appreciate a device's worth or are not able to recognise the qualities of this device. Okay, so i have used this device for more than a week, and all i want to say is this device is really worth every penny. I'll list down the pros and cons now: Pros: 1) This monster battery of 5000mAh can power you through 2 days no doubt. 2) Considering that Amoled display is absent, it still is on par with it and you'll not be disappointed with display for sure. 3) The USB-C type Adaptive fast charger is really a beast. It charges the phone really, really quickly. 4) The Face ID and Fingerprint sensors are very responsive. 5) The new Samsung experience UI is very well optimised, very responsive and you'll not face any lag whatsoever. 6) The In-Built Dolby Atmos lets you adjust the quality of your output sound in several ways. 7) The design of this device really feels premium and handles well. 8) Lastly, the gaming performance is good if not the best. All those negative reviews saying it can't run PUBG; it lags during the game, etc. can't possibly be true. I've played PUBG on the Balanced setting and runs very smoothly, no noticeable frame drops or lag. Although if you want to play on HD settings you might get a tad bit of frame drops, and yes it does heat up near the camera region but it is non-existent to me since i have a back cover LOL. Cons: 1) The cameras. They're not upto the mark i'd say. Though they have inserted the new Wide-angle feature in cameras, i still don't feel as if the photos are good. 2) It's quite heavy, but considering it's huge battery and display, that is inevitable. 3) The fingerprint sensor is placed a bit higher on backside that makes it a little hard to reach. 4) The Aspect ratio. Whenever i have to watch a video on youtube or chrome, the notch area and navigation bar area are not fully covered. Although you can enable the fullscreen mode on these apps, it doesn't help since the video gets cropped significantly. I'd like to know a workaround for that. Apart from these cons the device is really the BEST in this price range. Also considering this is a Samsung device, you can rest assured that this is bound to last long unlike the other Chinese smartphones (lol you know which ones i'm talking abt). Hope I helped!"
151572,mobile,"Pretty good ,but bass quality is not up to the mark."
153625,mobile accessories,"Samsung Galaxy M20 is a very good device. Its camera is just above average and good quality IPS LCD screen with good viewing angle I could say. Fingerprint scanner works almost 90 - 95% time for me. Personally don't have any issues from its exynos 7885 octa core processor. Its 4 gb RAM easily handle my day to day uses, battery life is insane cuse I easily got 5 hours of SOT, thanks to its 5000 mAh battery. Don't have any heating or lagging issues till now. It is a value of money devise and I'm ok with it."

He is a businessman and have hobby of photography. 2 things which he really need in a phone is good camera quality and high battery life as he attends 50-60 calls in a day and heavy use of internet as well. He is using the phone from last 3 weeks approx. and he is quite happy with the phone picture quality as he is able to send lot of his product image to his customer sitting in different cities and able to use the phone whole day in a single charge, That's what he needed!

Fingerprint reader got very slow now.. I don't even remember that there is a option of face unlock. Earlier it was working fine but now it takes more than 5-6 sec to unlock. DON'T BUY IT GUYS.

138543,mobile,"It is an okay headphone with decent sound quality. Not to expect much in this price tag and segment. But if you are an irregular, infrequent user then this is fine.

118389,mobile,"Bought it for my mother. As their usage is limited, she really liked the phone. No issue so far, phone is working perfectly whether it's video call or a normal call. Sound, camera speakers every thing is perfect according to its price"
135517,smartTv,"I have used it with my mobile, laptop and TV. Great sound output. There is slight distortion at higher volume but I do not listen to music at that volume. May be a bit over priced. The size makes it very convenient to include in your luggage."
152294,smartTv,"Pros - => the built quality is decent => it fits in a pocket => The grip is good due to rubber skin Cons - => the sound quality is TERRIBLE => Its highs are NOT clear => definitely NOT a rich sound => The highest volume is not any better than my HP laptop My opinion - It's highly disappointing. Bought it for watching movies, now its indifferent than my laptop, not at par with expectations from JBL. Boat or some other brand these days produce much better surround sound than this. The only good part about this is the size. Choose Wisely - SOUND or BRAND? Want to go for a brand, go ahead and get disappointed."
157164,mobile,"The best in the market till date, I'm highly satisfied after almost one month usage. It has the best processing skills, best camera giving excellent shots in day and night and excellent software. I didn't have any problem at all though a lot of people have told about battery draining fast but one thing needs to be mentioned that the battery gets charged very quickly too...You don't need to wait a lot.

113171,mobile,"As the description suggests, the phone has an amazing battery life. I binge watch series, play games, surf on social media and the phone goes on without charging for almost 3 days. I can go on long trips without bothering to take the power bank. I am yet to purchase a cover and glass, however I did drop the phone down and it survived!! No broken peices or scratches on the screen. So fair to say it survived the drop test. The screen clarity is great. This can be seen especially when you play games on this phone. I took some time getting used to the UI of this phone as the phone I previously had was not this updated. However within two days I was able to navigate easily. The camera of this phone is good, however not the best I've seen. It taken good photos if the subject is near, however if the subject is far, the photos come out a little blurry. In conclusion I would say this phone is worth every penny spent on it. I bought this phone during the Amazon great Indian festival and thus got a good discount too."
161579,mobile accessories,"Using it from the past 3 months. Fingerprint scanner is good.no issues with it Decent camera.could be a little better when it comes to colour optimization Decent performance by the processor.as I am not a gamer, it performance of daily tasks is well upto the mark.

116379,smartTv,"Being an Amazon Customer from last 7 years that too being in US and India. This is first product which I am heavily disappointed with Amazon. Had it been a cheap Chinese Product, could have digested but not Amazon. Always believed Amazon is at par in Technology with Google/Apple. I ordered the Product but after 3-4 days the remote pairing stopped and finally asked for exchange. After exchange, the remote pairing stops again after another 2-3 days and return period from Amazon is just 10 days. Had it been purchased from US, where the return period is 30 days being Prime Members and any defect they are good with returns/exchanges. Finally CS comes to help where after brief call of around 40 min, we were able to pair the remote. I thanked and hoped that I don't see the problem again. While I was thanking the CS executive, the pairing stops again. So did the entire exercise again and it worked but the remote keeps getting unpaired often. A wonderful product/idea but manufacturing killed it. PS: I've used Roku and Chromecast from last 5 years and never faced even a single issue. I needed another streaming device for my 3rd TV and kids also start hating it."
139019,mobile,It took me few days to start using the phone as I was traveling...meanwhile I was reading the reviews other fellow buyers of M30S in this forum and especially those low scored reviews caught my attention. I just want to ask you all a question how could one just give 1 star rating for this phone... ya there are some kind of draw back or touch points which does not meet one's expectations in any product... but 1 star is unwarranted. This phone is way worthy than 3 star easily. Personally I can't ask for more for this pricing. Its brilliant strategy to disrupt the cluttered Chinese brands.. Good effort Samsung
122527,mobile,Excellent mobile phone üì± battery life is not good
151260,mobile accessories,Please do not buy this phone. I personally experienced hell out of problems with this phone. You will be scared by seeing and experienving the over heated battery within 10-15 mins of continuous usage. Battery is draining like hell. Its like eye masking theory towards customers by hyping the adds in amazon. One of the worst product I have booked through amaxon.

If you love an iphone you love it and if you do not,then you are in a minority anyway and won't be reading this review :P My daughter bought this last year and she is extremely happy, she says this is the most value for money proposition. She is a professional photographer and nowadays most of the time she uses this iphone only for clicking photos and they come out very professional. Tonnes of apps, super duper fast phone, amazing photos, very nice music, clear screen, the ONLY COMPLAINT is the battery life sucks! The battery drains very very fast and iphone does not take very good pics in darker situation, that is the only thing. Otherwise it is perfect phone."

Over all performance is good and worth of money what you spend. No other phone in this range gives you these many features. Battery backup is also excellent. It's one of the best phones available in this range.

This laptop screen does not open much its just till 90 degree. Also the original pro e shown is high and then it make you feel as if they are giving you high discount but it's the actual price.. Not happy with the quality
114093,refrigerator,Awesome go for it
133875,mobile,I am using it for charging my miPad. It is serving my purpose well. I am not able to comment on 'charging power' or durability. It seems it is sturdy. Not a disappointing buy.

154345,mobile,Sleep tracking is really accurate. Falling Short for watch faces due to biased company policy.
124225,mobile,"First thing in this mobile,phone display it is amazing because of super amoled. Battery is 6000mah but it can only last for 21hrs if u see videos for at least 5 to 6hrs. Otherwise if ur using only for phone calls,browsing and WhatsApp then it can last for 30hrs. Finger print unlock is very good for this price. Camera: coming to camera it is good for outdoor photos but when u take in indoor it is not so good,but I'm ok with it because of this price u can't expect like iPhone clarity. So overall i give rating for this phone 4.3/5"

150851,mobile,"Phone was good in this price but little heating problems and the 48 megapixel camera is not good sa compared to others devices ,Samsung a50 capture better photos than this which is 25 megapixel but I switched to m30s due to its massive 6000 mah battery which is surprisingly awesome"

114933,mobile,Awsome
124558,mobile,Front camera is good but selfie is disappointment. Battery back is little to worry but fast charging does the job. If you are camera lover and looking for budget phone then go for it.
152286,mobile,"Prompt delivery by Amazon. The colour, body are simply as expected. The front camera could have been better, but at this price range, you cant expect much. The 16 gb storage could have been increased to atleast 32 gb, though. I am not a gaming person, but for browsing, etc., the phone works fine. A con, I must mention is, the positioning of the speaker. If the phone is kept on a surface (we always do that), the ring of the phone becomes extremely diminished in.volume. But, for this range, you can blindly go for it."

As iPhone 11 is now in competition that has dual camera and A13 chip and front camera upgraded it is still decent choice for users who are switching first time on iphone or upgrading from 6/7/8. It is a good looking iphone u can choose from ur fav colour, Has a good battery backup could have been better. Smooth functioning thanks to A12 chip set, Although it has single camera but it does justice both front and rear, if apple provide night mode through software update that will surely make a difference."

113170,smartTv,"As that statement i‚Äôve Made , this Bluetooth Sound Link ii is juts amazing . First of all Bose makes speaker that aren‚Äôt suppose to sound like others. The Sound Clearity is 100% Clear & Pure . What I mean is be it JBL or even Sony Or HK. They all have same quality of Electronics but in Bose the Speakers are designed to give you indirect sound which makes the room more lively & every corner you can feel the music ! I am a common Salaried person & for me this is expensive products, like everyone else‚Äôs i went thru all other Similar Bluetooth Speakers which were under this 16K belt . But I bought this on EMI basis & trust me I loved it after hearing the sound , now I believe why people said ‚Äú once you hear Bose Audio System you‚Äôll forget everything else !‚Äù It‚Äôs totally True . If you are planning to purchase this & you find yourself confused , please go to a Bose store & take a live Demo of the music of your taste. You will be pleased by its quality . My Playlist Consist more of classic like Roxette, George Micheal, Elton John, To the new age & recent Coldplay , imagine Dragons, Kygo etc . The Sound is so much better on this . And the last , when you carry it out with friends or for a small get together guys , you know it‚Äôs BOSE, it makes a Differnce coz not everyone can own this. For me this is my best Purchase & hence I am gonna save & buy a Bose Home Audio System too ! Nothing else will do ..."
153680,mobile accessories,Samsung M30 phone's biggest plus point is Super AMOLED screen. It's just Awesome. Best visual treat for ur eyes. Overall phone gripping is good.

118290,smartTv,Boot time is reduced in 4k version. Buy 4k only if you have sufficient bandwidth to support 4k videos. And a disclaimer not all online videos are 4k. They are specially made and only selective ones are available in 4k resolution. Also you need to have a 4k tv. So just be aware that buying 4k fire stick will not play everything on a 4k resolution. Non 4k version also works very well and a good buy if you are using standard tv. The only difference in standard viewing is boot time. Rest is more or less same
138075,mobile,"Internet is not very fast. Camera quality is very poor. Battery life is not satisfactory, display quality is poor. What‚Äôs more in a phone. I would never recommend it to buy rather one should go for any other phone in this price. Even Samsung is offering better phone in this price."

159326,books,"This book is not updated. It is better to go for an updated book on Environment especially with the addition of new events like Kew's Report 2016, Chennai Flood, Paris Climate agreement etc. The book covers a wide array of topics but it is mere a compilation rather than being a conceptual book, which is the need of the UPSC. At places, concepts are explained vaguely. There are lots of unnecessary information as well (like too much detail of endangered species, reports verbatim reproduction of acts and policies related to environment etc.), which may harm a beginner, who is unaware of what exactly is to read. It is better to go for A Comprehensive Guide to Environment and Ecology (By R Rajagopalan) , published by LexisNexis. This book has all the updated stuffs including Uttarakhand disaster, Chennai floods etc. It also provides a better and analytical understanding of the environment. Apart from these, there is a chapter-wise compilation of UPSC previous years' questions of Environment (both prelim and main), which is really helpful. Better to go for Rajagopalan sir's book rather than this book."

If you go through the speed test in You Tube, the other products wins the game by two or three seconds..How many of us go for a mobile speed test with others??? AMOLED is magnificent. Batterlife fantastic. I am a medium user and battery last for 2 days easily...Picture quality excellent. No Hanging issues...I was worried about the processor..but so far so good. A decent product I would say. I give 4.5 stars"

This phone has all the basic sansors over all its a good phone in this price segment .

143456,smartTv,"My honest review... I have bought this smart tv after reading many reviews and I felt I took the good decision. It‚Äôs pocket friendly I bought on 10500 rupees. Moreover I got this On no cost EMI from HDFC debit card. About TV good remote control. Every application have in installed already like Netflix, Prime amazon, Hotstar, YouTube and also music player moreover they have their own channel where you can watch what you like. Easy to use. Even My father also could play his own favourite movies without my help. If u are not interested to take the DTH connections your TV is already with many feathers to watch. Cast mirroring is also available in this small budget but I wish this TV could accept Motorola mobile to Mirroring so more I could enjoy. But I am very satisfied with this product and I would suggest you all folks who are living alone and looking for budget smart TV then this TV is the best."

He puts very congent arguments to answer some really good questions like- -How Homo sapiens became the most intelligent species on the planet and not any other animal ? -How religions came into existence ? -How Benjamin Franklin disarmed the Gods ? -How languages came into existence ? (It was not for communication) -Why human baby is born underdeveloped while the offspring of other animals are able to walk and eat within a short span of time ? and much more fascinating theories about the evolution and formation of our social structure."

156944,mobile,"The Samsung Galaxy M30s can be seen as an upgrade over the existing Galaxy M30. It retains its predecessor's good attributes, such as the crisp AMOLED display, and bumps the battery capacity up to 6,000mAh which helps deliver better battery life. The new Exynos 9611 SoC is more powerful than the Exynos 7904, and offers similar levels of performance as other popular processors at the same price point in the market. The cameras on the M30s are one area in which Samsung still needs to put in some work. We often found focusing to be slow, and the camera performance in low light was below average. If battery life ranks very high on your priority list, then you should consider the Galaxy M30s."

124264,smartTv,"Firstly I wanted to return the product due to low volume. The technical team said that it cant be returned as that is the highest volume provided. With no other option I started playing with the device and came to know the long press increased its volume. Its really loud, I loved it. Then I realized there is a usage guide provided along with the product provided. One suggestion to technical team is guide the customers on using the device instead of saying the product cant be returned."

157016,mobile,The backup of this power bank is good in less price of rs 699. I am using it from the past one month no issue has occured.
124005,mobile accessories,Fingerprint reader works well and speedily. All cameras are working well and beautifully. Battery life stands well even internet and wifi if always on. Night mode and screen display and design is superior. Dolby works well. Quickly charge and works well. Single speaker makes me feel slightly bad- Quality of sound is super. 7884B works well. G71 ALSO good. Consider dedicated Assistant Buttom. Give one more speaker.
131514,mobile,"Got this one at 11,099 with exchange which makes it a steal deal for me Got it delivered within 2 days of ordering . The screen looks GREAT! Samsung has the best displays in the industry, and this one is no exception. . The camera quality is also very good as compared to the competition and the wide angle camera is sweet. . An A++ for battery life plus the fast charge bundled in the box, also the device is very light . The performance is great to . But one setback is the design, the plastic back spoils the feel a bit, as compared to the reamle 5/pro as well as the redmi note 8 launched today. . If design is not ur priority then, A perfect device at this price, Go for itüî•"

151435,smartTv,Poor pic.quality
115729,mobile,Battery life and camera is too good
120010,mobile accessories,Cons: 1. Finger print reader - too slow compare to competitors. 2. 720p display - when you are reading or watching a video in high-resolution you will notice the lack of sharpness 3.Brightness - screen is not bright enough on outdoors and minimum brightness it won't go below 14. It's hard to see screen in outdoor and in the complete dark situation. 4. Color Accuracy - it is not good most of the colours contrast is too high and sharper Pro 1. Camera - Especially Gcam night sight is fabulous. 2. Battery - Compromise on the screen resolution and mid processor makes battery last longer. Below average compare to the other competitors like realme.
148409,mobile,Ok
142537,mobile,Magnifique product. Writing this review after 2 days of usage. Pros: 1. Mind blowing battery performance(10/10). 2.

Rear and front Camera performance is good in low light conditions. 7. Battery lasts for 2 days on average usage. 8. Sound is good. 9. Samoled display is good. Cons: 1. Rear camera would be better for 48 mp. 2. A bit bulky.

156526,mobile,"TLDR: An okay product designed for people with low to moderate phone usage. Frankly speaking, this is a mediocre product at best. The camera is okay, the sound quality is good. The battery life is poor. However this phone sports a simultaneous dual VoLTE standby at the cost of extremely heavy battery usage and phone heating. Note that this product does not include headsets."

124152,refrigerator,"First of all fridge is just 4feet 8 inches, this is the smallest fridge available in this range, storage space is less, but other features are good like smart inverter,door cooling etc. However at this price range in 2019 this can't even hold a candle to the whirlpool,hair and Samsung fridges. My advice don't buy this even though this fridge is working perfectly fine for me but when your storage is so less at this price what will I do with a smart inverter!!!, fridge is useless and lg is just looting people with their brand name. Better go for a three door 5 star fridge of whirlpool you will get it at this price. This is a good fridge , but the products which other companies have at this price range it's better to go for them. To give a comparison, this fridge is like a Sony mobile phone you know it will be good but no one buys them now as other companies provide more features with better quality at that price range."

134058,mobile,"I am writing this review after using this phone for more than 10 days now . I upgraded this phone from iPhone 7 . The phone is really good , worth a buy if its on good sale . 128gb - around 55k camera - quality is really good and better from 7 . Both front and back side camera .The colours is very original . Battery - It lasts for about 18hrs as I personally use it more for social media . GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS . Charging - it may take more time then iPhone 7 to charge the phone (That is the draw back for this phone ) Very slow charging !!!! I will personally not suggest to use other iPhone charger in this phone because there is a little problem with that . Face Unlock - It works pretty good and fast even at night when the lights is off . You may find little problem when you are using your earphone and trying to unlock the phone . It generally takes time or does not accept . Every other time either you are wearing glasses even with SUNGLASSES it works pretty good and fast . As the size of the phone is bigger from iPhone 7 it takes a while to get comfortable with it . Accessing full phone with single hand is difficult or not possible . Gaming - I have bought 128gb phone which is very nice that too on sale . the phone doest hang on heavy games . Display - The display quality is really good specially the night and day effect , it automatically sense out the mode so its really good for eyes . It doest damage the eyes or effect them . even in low brightness you can comfortably see all apps and read the data . All over its a good device and worth a buy if you buy it on SALE ."

136977,mobile accessories,I used this phone last 3 months and find it s sooo wonderful
124810,smartTv,"Get the best out of this TV by reading this review. Let's start: I bought the 32 inch smart TV (no air remote of whatever they call - that keyboard on the back of the remote) for 8100 (8999/- was the deal price and 10% discount on SBI card at that time). The installation was hassle free and the guy came well within 2 days. No issues of any kind. The only bad thing was that I was sent the manual for the different version (the one with keyboard on the remote's back). I'm fine with the video quality but audio lack Bass completely. It's okay for watching serials/news etc but for music and movies, one may find it bland. The total space is around 5GB which will be shared among the apps you'll be installing and the data you'll be downloading. It's sufficient actually. I am not using Dish or cable but use apps like JioTv/Hotstar and other free apps :P As I have 20 mbps net, I never face buffering issues. BONUS: This TV has fully functional integrated GOOGLE PLAY STORE apart from the TV Store. Check attached screenshots and read Tip 3. Issue 1. Remote on android phone: As other reviews said that EShare app can be used to use phone as a remote but I didn't receive that on my TV and tried several versions of the same but to no avail. Solution 1: Found this app named 'CetusPlay' on TV store. Installed that on TV and installed the same on phone (from Google Play store). Do note that I had tried several apps prior to that but none of them worked. Issue 2: Even Cetus Play doesn't connect to the TV despite showing the common WiFi the TV and phone are using. Solution 2: Check your router's settings and disable 'AP Isolation' somewhere from Wireless settings. Issue 3: All devices can't Cast to the TV. Solution 3: Mi and some companies allow casting whereas some others like Motorola won't allow that as these companies supports Google (Chromecast) and not Miracast. Still, you can at least cast your downloaded videos/photos using CetusPlay app. You can also stream videos/movies through CetusPlay by clicking 'Link Transfer' from the menu options. Tip 1: If you find it difficult to use phone as a remote, buy a wireless touchpad + keyboard for approx 500/- It's sure worth it. Tip 2: If you have Jio SIM, you can use JioTV for TV. Find and download JioTV app from TV store and watch HD channels without any issue - even star network channels without needing Hotstar app. Tip 3: Open Google Play Store: Connect to CetusPlay app => Click My Apps => Click 'System apps' folder => Find and click on Google Play Store once. You can add the credentials from settings option of TV or from here. Download some custom launcher from Play Store (HAL Launcher- found this the best). Cons: The remote's buttons are very hard and I feel it's not durable. So, I don't use it much. The remote's Power button - Sometimes I have to press it 2-3 times to turn it on. It doesn't have speech input. In a nutshell it's a great buy for 8100/- It's been almost a month and it's working great so far. Planning to buy a couple more in the coming months if it doesn't go kaput."
167547,mobile,bought my sister and she was very happy

118568,smartTv,"Brought the tv at 49,999. Incredible clarity, color and picture quality. Ticks a lot of boxes and carries an tempting price tag. Pros: Excellent motion handling Very good HDR performance 20w dolby digital audio Cons: Doesn't have Bluetooth connectivity"
134244,mobile,"I bought the product on the very first day of great Indian sale ( 6GB variant). To be honest the phone is awesome and it's worth for the money. 6000Mah battery is very good it lasts easily for 1.5 days if you are full time user..For Moderate user it will last definitely more than 2 days. Look wise the phone is very sleek and premier..Even the back is plastic, it has some shiny finish that looks gr8 for this price range. ( Opal black vll be good choice ) Performance: I am using this phone for last 2 days..Until now it performs very well ,very good ram management, no hanging issues or anything. Very smooth performance.. Camera: Picture quality doesn't look like 48mp but it shot very good snaps. Most of the people saying poor camera blah blah..Don't mind them... What we pay is what we get..It is definitely worth for the money we paid. Overall This is one of the best phone with such a huge battery in mid range segment. Battery backup is really good.Also don't compare with realme , Redmi etc. Whatever specs those people give, Samsung stands out.. Because brand name always matters. Super amoled screen , 6000mah battery , Triple camera , Super slow motion ...Just Wow Just go for it without thinking Regards"

118467,smartTv,"Bought this on 16th June and on 10th July ( less than a month) the HDMI1 port stopped working. Now running around and Samsung people come, check and then keep taking time to send someone else. Now talking about changing motherboard. This is the quality Samsung gives that in less than a month a TV gets spoilt and it's like now having a second hand TV. Won't do a replacement which ethically should be done My suggestion is not to buy this!"

This monster can, take pics at par wherein professional Flim Industry use high end DSLRs. Infact in some bollywood movies, D5300 is used recording the cinemas.Now regarding Amazon, I must say, delivery time is extremely good & much before than the expected time. The quality of material/ packaging & people involved in shipment/ dispatch was fabulous & very polite. In totality, I am very happy & satisfied with dealings through Amazon. Since I am a regular purchaser from Amazon, so the shipment quality/ people involved in deliveries, can be treated as a gross feedback from my end. However, this in turn presets a very high expectations from Amazon, so benchmarking would be tough going forward.... !!!!!!"

As far as the other most important feature which I wanted was a longer battery life and I always Trust Samsung with this. I had Samsung A7 before M30 and both phone has awesome battery life. The other features which I like about my M30 is its two tone body colour the all over display and the best one is the Fingerprint reader through which I and only I can unlock my phone. Thank you Samsung for M30"

157499,mobile accessories,"The design and ergonomics of the phone are really great. However you may at once feel that the display is somewhat disappointing, esp if there are other mobiles on the tables within the same price range.

Laptop stopped working after 4-5 days of actual use and 35 days after purchase.Dell support website first asked to bring laptop to service center and after asking for onsite support took 2:30 hours of troubleshooting, then concluded Hard drive and mother board to be replaced for this brand new laptop. Technician came and replaced Motherboard and SSD drive, when I asked to install Windows from image in pend drive ( which I had to create image by myself for which I had to purchase a Pen drive and borrow laptop from friend ) he said they don't Support windows installation and left.When I tried to re install Windows from flash drive as suggested by Dell , Laptop didn't respond and gave same error as "" SSD not detected"". Dell again sent technician to troubleshooting , Technician had again removed motherboard and SSD and reinstalled combinations of both multiple times ,which did not resolved issue.As this is brand new laptop and not working I asked for replacement from Amazon and Dell ,they both refused.Now Dell is asking me again replacement of some parts.So my investment of 45000 ruppes in Dell laptop gone in gutters."

134321,smartTv,"I bought this offline for 73k still it's worth every penny spend.. not only is it a gaming laptop but also a productive one thanks to simple yet stealthy design which doesn't shout out.. ""more like a 007 design among gaming laptops"" you also get software optimizations as well. The free lifetime MS office is a charm. Another one is that you'd watch 4k content too! There'll be often file explorer crashes due to antivirus software but this could be solved by simply updating to the latest software. The only con! Is it's webcam which can be neglected considering some laptops priced higher don't give one, and YES!! IT'S WAY MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY fruit(Mac) products of the same price point"

116343,mobile,"Before I start this review I‚Äôll let you know, I love the Apple brand and I‚Äôve never used a 1080p OLED phone in my life (This screen seems perfectly normal to me). That being said I‚Äôll dive into the review. I got this phone on the Prime day sale and I‚Äôve been using it for almost a month now and here are my thoughts about this phone. Hardware: The phone‚Äôs frame is made of aluminum (matching the color of your phone) and is sandwiched between two glass panels, this gives the phone a premium feel. It is extremely slippery and will start to slide off a perfectly flat surface when the phone vibrates. On the front side, I love the 6.1‚Äù screen (800p resolution doesn‚Äôt bother me, as mentioned earlier). I only wish Apple would‚Äôve used a curved screen like Samsung does. The notch doesn‚Äôt bother me at all, I got used to it in about a couple of days. The buttons are all clicky and I love the slider for the silencing the phone. The phone does not come with a 3.5mm headphone jack to lightning converter (Apple should‚Äôve included this). Software: I‚Äôm using the latest iOS (iOS 12.4) as of writing this review and it‚Äôs really fluid. I like the gestures and the lack of the home button is nice. Everything is super smooth and nothing lags (except ‚Äúendless ducker ‚Äì game‚Äù). iMessage and face time are real nice apps to use and I like the fact that you can send messages with effects to apple users. I did have an issue with iMessage activation but a trip to the nearby future world solved it, on the topic of iMessage you have to pay 5 bucks to activate iMessage (just once). The App store is cool too and I like the other pre-installed apps that come with the phone. This phone should get iOS updates for at least 5 years that‚Äôs until 2023! Usage: I feel really comfortable using this phone; I got the hang of how everything works in a week or so. Don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôre an Android user and want to switch to iOS, It is really simple. The camera (rear) is good; it takes great photos and can shoot stunning videos. I like the SLO-MO very much. The portrait mode is good, but not great (sometimes it‚Äôll blur out your hair). The selfie camera is also good, take clear, crisp selfies. One handed use is difficult, but it doesn‚Äôt bother me much, I normally use both my hands to hold any phone above 5.5‚Äù. The air drop feature is like icing on the cake, it allows me to transfer files to other Apple devices at great speeds, and it works like magic. Final thoughts: Look, I‚Äôm by no way trying to justify the price Apple charges for their iPhones, but I am trying to tell you that this is one great phone with superb features to match the looks, which gets updates for half a decade, has excellent customer service, will get better if you have other Apple products and will get other‚Äôs attention easily. In my opinion if you‚Äôre going to spend over 50K for a smartphone and if the lifetime of the phone matters, you‚Äôll be well off with this phone than any other android phone. As the say ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have an iPhone, you just don‚Äôt have an iPhone‚Äù (emphasis on don‚Äôt)."

134496,books,"I can genuinely say this book changed the way I look at life, career and personal development. It kinda opened my eyes. The system is rigged against the small fellow. The more I thought about it more I agreed with Rich Dad. It highlighted to me the perils of depending on salary as primary means of income in today's age. It highlighted importance of investing and generation of passive income from your investments. Rich Dad tells you to invest wisely and earn enough passive income from your investments so as to become financially free and secure. That is the path to financial nirvana. Rich Dad tells us to take responsibility for our financial future and not depend on any corporation or government. I followed many of his advice to good success. It changed my financial life. Its been now 15 years since I first read this book. Lot has been changed in these 15 years. But the advice of Rich Dad is timeless and true. If you listen to him then it will change your life too."

159818,refrigerator,"This is my review after a year long usage. I was able to exchange my old working refrigerator for this baby and it was worth it. It has zero problems, lots of shelves and works without any noise. Only problem is if you have to use bigger vessels to store then you have to remove 1 of the glass shelf. Also its interesting to know after 2-3 years the star rating sets at 2 no matter what star level you buy. So this is 4 star product and in 2-3 years it will demote itself to 2 star, that's something the product should mention. Installation is free and LG product service personnel was really helpful. Best Diwali purchase so far :)"

137095,mobile,"I was looking for a good camera phone thats why i choose Samsung M30s. After using it for a month here are my views. Pros 1. Camera quality is superb with different mode available for clicking pic like best shot, vide angle shot, also pics in night and dark are also good with fflash option. 2. Battery life is good. I am not a continuous user of phone, use it only for 1-2 hours hardly in a day. So as per that i can say battery life is ok. 3. Fingerprint scanner is good. However when other brands are offering on screen finger scanner. 4. Video recording quality is awesome and with many modes like live focus, slow motion, ultra slow motion, still video you can experiment too. Cons 1. Its heavy, beleive it as compared to other brands its very heavy. U can use for zyming also. Just kidding. But really, its really heavy. 2. Camera night mode is giving blurred images. Here i mean the speacialy provided Night Mode of camera. It works without flash. So the image quality is not as good as compared to pics clicked with normal camera mode in night using flash. 3.As usual, samsung phone gets slow with time. Even with 6 GB RAM, its behaving like a 3/4 GB RAM mobile. Hope these points will help you. I will add more points in future."

123855,mobile accessories,"Finger reader can be made more sensitive to touch. Camera quality is excellent. Battery life is good with around 100 apps installed other than system app and gives a 1 and half day battery life without any gaming apps. Phone slightly lags in some applications inspite of having high speed internet. Camera lags in some options but give good still photos while moving without any blurring. Areas of improvement: sensitivity of fingerprint reader, camera lag in some modes, and other RAM improvements. It doesn't make you feel you are using a 6GB RAM phone."

124713,mobile accessories,"GOOD: + water resistant - this is a huge improvement for me! +increased speed is noticeable w Siri. +the capacity is amazing! (I have the 256) I can keep movies, videos, books, photos, music etc without having to store on iCloud or the like (which usually involves a monthly fee). + decent size (same as iPhone 6S) while remaining portable and although not as big as the 7 Plus, it can still fit in pocket. +Widget feature (swiping to right at home screen) has been improved and now allows editing. You can add or delete features which can be key for privacy and being able to customize is always a good thing. +has lots of added fun features in iMessage (not sure if its the updated software or strictly iPhone 7) like memes, automatic replies and being able to write w your fingertip. +camera takes much better pics (increased the megapixels and the difference is noticeable) and it has 5X zoom capability. +has the fingerprint option for quicker access after you enter your 6 digit pass code to begin. +the style and sleekness of the new Jet Black option is a thing of beauty. It's almost criminal to cover it (but necessary for me). +even slimmer than the iPhone 6 but still able to stand up against something for convenient viewing. +speaker upgrade as it now provides stereo (not up to audiophile standards but still). BAD: - no headphone jack!! but box includes dongle (see photo) which inserts into charging port and provides headphone jack - I have a bet with myself on how long it will take to lose. I know wireless headphones are the future but happy with my old faithful headphones. -the home button is not as well defined. Its gonna take longer than 24 hrs to get used to as it takes me a few tries to activate the home button. It requires the right amount of pressure and despite offering three different options, not easy. The guys at the Apple Store need to stop showing off - on the bright side, I'm thinking it's a learning curve thing and continued use should take care of this issue. FINAL THOUGHTS: Is it worth the extra money? I'm not so sure but despite the two drawbacks, which I think are a temporary, I'm loving the features and ease of the iPhone 7 and the Jet Black is beyond elegant and sleek. I will provide update after continued usage"
159936,smartTv,"This is the best LED tv in this segment.

It supports play store, Netflix, amazon prime, hotstar,etc...... In my opinion if u wanna a tv at cheap price go for it.My dreams came true after having this beautiful tv ...

141421,mobile,"LIKES 1) Super slender beautiful phone. Reminds me of the onePlus 3. I have the red A2 and it is shinier and more attractive than the Xiaomi Rocco Red Poco F1. 2) Android one, just updated to pie with March 2019 security update ( 2 updates from the original Android Oreo, each more than 1 GB) 3) snappy all round, no slowdown. And camera is more than sufficient. Camera bump is a 'non issue' for me. 4) Super quick fingerprint scanner. Probably the fastest. 5) No ugly notch. The Mi A2 is probably the last ""non notch"" phone. 6) The Pie feature ""ambient display"" works well. The first I have seen on a LCD screen. UPDATE : ASUS zenfone max pro m1 android pie also now supports it and implementation is better ( floating time shows in screen while being charged) 7} No MIUI. Which means one doesn't have to dig deep to SWITCH OFF advertising from MIUI software. 8) Pricing.. Android one for this price? Difficult to turn down. DISLIKES 1) Xiaomi Android's system takes 13 GB of precious space. 2) it takes time to get used to the gestures based controls. 3) taking screenshot is cumbersome ( ie long press power button and tapping the screenshot option) Note : the Android P version only has the "" volume down PLUS power button"" option. 3) There is no option to take scrolling screenshot. 4) Apps still closes after a few minutes of using another app ( despite the 4 GB RAM) 5) slippery, probably the most slippery phone around ( the included TPU case is very appreciated) 6) No 3.5 mm Jack. Also volume is much lower on headphones using the bundled USB-C to 3.5 mm dongle. 7) This is a dual SIM standby phone, NOT a dual SIM active. ( For eg. The Zenfone pro Max M1 and M2, OnePlus 6 & 6T, Pocophone.. are dual active 4G LTE ) Even the 8) On landscape mode, one cannot reach the Settings menu from the pull down. (also seen on vanilla like android pie NOT named OnePlus) 9) LCD brightness is one of the very lowest. ( I had to turn off automatic brightness multiple times) 10) Battery life is ""meh"". Power user will need to charge at least twice daily. Overall, I'd take this phone over any other phone except the excellent Poco F1."

It's good looking, compact, sturdy and efficient. It has all the features I need - an HD display, loud sound and an easy user iterface.

136406,mobile,"I ordered Samsung Galaxy New M30 on Prime sale with a view to exchange my old OnePlus. It took 4 days to receive the phone perhaps due to hectic sale season and also need to arrange pickup of old phone. I was expecting a fairly bulky phone given the huge battery capacity and low price. The phone turned out to be sleek and very well designed. Configuring the phone was smooth and didn't take anytime! After my first charge on Oct 03, the charge lasted for almost 5 days with medium use - calls, websurfing, some photos etc. The turbocharger is a boon to heavy users like me. The camera(s) is nice with terrific resolution. The fingerprint recognition is a bit slow and needs 2-3 touches sometimes. Overall, a very nice mobile at a killer price point for a Samsung device!"

131637,mobile,Great
136938,mobile,I use from 2 years no any type problem. Happy..
142039,mobile accessories,Looks average.Back cover is made of plastic which does not give premium look like other phones at this price. Display is super amoled which is fantastic. Battery life is long enough (with normal use 48h after complete charging).Fast charging facility is given. But camera quality is not upto the mark as it is 48 MP. Pictures are average and it take some time to save after click. Overall its a good choice at this price..
120413,mobile,"Delivery mode was not fast as I expected as a prime member. Packaging was not good as expected. Mobile is working still fine. No heating and unexpected shutdown issue. iPhone is updated to latest iOS 11.2.5. Camera quality is far better than my old Sony Xperia Z5 Dual. As a photographer, if you are mobile photographer so must try with iPhone 6s. In older flagship models of apple only 6s Plus has OIS. But don't worry. Without it you can shoot very clear and focused images."
148824,mobile accessories,One of the best phone by honor.. But the picture quality is not so good... But the battery life is just awesome..
134281,mobile,"I bought this for my child who later complained that the phone lags and the battery consumption is high. I called the customer care and they refused to refund or even upgrade to a higher/costlier version of MI Redmi mobile. I researched online and found that Android ver. 8 requires at least 3GB RAM for a seamless experience. The technical support executive agreed to this but said that the mobile can only be replaced with the same model only if the piece were defective. So, the lessons learned are - 1) Research about the hardware requirements of the Android version before you buy, 2) If possible, try out the same model at some offline store or elsewhere before you buy, 3) Note that there are no refunds or upgrades possible after you purchase from Amazon - You'll be stuck with what you buy. As for this mobile, after using it for sometime, I find the performance as ordinary. If your use is high, then go for better versions or mobiles."
118015,smartTv,Bestest.....go for it
165168,mobile,"Well before purchasing any phone, I researched in details and finally I focused on realme xt, vivo z1pro and m30s. XT was costly and Z1 was not having type c charging port finally buy m30s because of battery, super amoled screen and my trust in Samsung as a brand. After 1 month I feel it's a great phone and I am fully satisfied with phone's performance in its budget. If anyone is planning to purchase a new phone explore mi note 8 pro if you trust mi, otherwise go for this one it's a great phone."
152771,mobile accessories,"REDMI 6 Pro, is one of the best phones with all the essential features. I feel it is actually under priced as per the specs and features. Battery life is good. Overall its the best phone in this segment."

137691,mobile accessories,If you're going to buy this phone for it's massive battery then don't go for it a battery of 6000mah don't even last for a single day!!! Specifically I don't even play games on it. It's battery promises are totally fake and really too disappointing from Samsung family. Apart from that camera is really very good Fingerprint sensor is way too fast Touch sensitivity is really good but doesn't work sometimes Phone started the problem of heating slowly slowly but it's not even 1 months of my purchase
167093,mobile,"after updating Android Pie, the picture quality has been degrade, network and flash also be not worked ..... Please never purchase any MI phone, the company policy has to degrade phone quality by bug updates when they launch a new phone."

166648,smartTv,Worthy product. Chromecast working fine. Picture and sound quality is good.
170596,mobile,worst Amazon app please dont buy anything From amazon app Ban or stop dis product soon it's waste of money buying dis phone any of apps not working properly n costumer care response s very horrible
156917,mobile,The Phone switches off automatically even when the battery is more than 80 %
157924,mobile,"The phone as whole package is a good one. Except of little things here and there, I liked the phone. The screen is probabily the highlight of the phone. It's beautiful and bright. The software by Samsung complimented such amazing screen. Vivid or natural, choose whatever you like, I usually like natural colors but vivid really shows capability of the screen, gamers might like it. Battery of course is huge. Currently did binge watching Young Sheldon during my tour and the phone really hold up to long duration of watching. Battery saver mode pushes it even more. Camera is average in my opinion. But you can't expect more at such great price. Only wish the speakers were better. They are terrible and songs doesn't sound so great. Earpiece speaker is also very loud. When speaking to someone on call I can feel the back of the phone vibrating when they speak. All in all, really impressed by this phone. Worth the price and deal."
128963,mobile,Good phone
124431,refrigerator,For this cost super product.i will give six star but some audio format not support.that reason only I give four star.kevin company also asked me to give five star rating.if you give five star rating we will give you extra waranty like that they told.but i will not give. I don't want extra waranty for such a nice product. I want please add sound format option.then only future buyer will get happy.otherwise i will give 6 star. I will sacrifice my waranty for future buyer happiness.thanks Kevin.you are smart.

128297,smartTv,Good for medium graphics gaming. Adobe Photoshop and illustrator works smoothly. The top surface of the screen lid is made of aluminium and rest is made of quality plastic. The product is designed very similar to Macbook Air.
118425,mobile,"Bought the pnone on tuesday, opal balck with 4gb+64gb specification. Found minor heating issues but to no concern. Camera quality is good and battery quality lives up to the expectation of 6000mah in respect. Screen quality is excellent and vibrant with samsung one ui features it brings good user frendly settings. The only con is the speakers are situated below as it sometimes might make the sound muffled if ur placing the phone in sone tight spaces. Other obvious troubles is no temperd glass or any back cover provided. Since it is only released online it makes it difficult to buy any back covers or temped glass from stores as they are only coming in after the release of the phone."

170087,mobile accessories,the phone is great overall. excellent in all manners. amazing amoled display. not yet tested the battery performance. but why is samsung lying about the camera? it says 48 MP but the pictures are very blurry. colour reproduction and dynamic range is good but no pixel sharpness at all. i was expecting a mediocre camera but did not expect camera to be so basic.
112943,mobile accessories,Apple is really useless phone. Even 8k rs phone offer much better features. It also hangs many times. Not worth buying.

133933,mobile,"I am using this phone for 2 weeks now and so far this phone performed more than what I expected from this phone. I won't be talking about specs here but my experience. - The best thing you‚Äôll like about this phone is the Display. You won‚Äôt notice individual pixel because of good resolution and OLED‚Äôs that Samsung provides is still a no match by other manufacturers. - The battery is the next best thing about this phone I like. The first charge gave me almost 3 days of usage, but that was something from 100% charge to 2%. On regular biases, I charge my phone every alternate day. - One UI is something that is definitely an improvement. Last time when I used a Samsung phone, it was a Galaxy tab 2 and it bloatware rich UI performed so bad, I thought I‚Äôll never use a Samsung phone again. A lot of things changed after, definitely the hardware has improved a lot but the One UI also brought a lot of improvements, which make the experience smoother, less cluttered and preserves most of the native android features in its original sense. - I don‚Äôt use the camera a lot, but the camera I feel is average. It will be good most of the time. - The fingerprint reader‚Äôs detection speed is average. - Build Quality. The looks-wise phone looks good, it‚Äôs glossy plastic. Build wise it doesn‚Äôt feel solid but it might few take bumps as plastic absorbs shocks in a better way compared to other materials. Overall experience: I feel Samsung balanced out by giving a good display and battery, saving some money on a chip which they manufacture themselves and keeping overall average hardware to achieve a phone like this. Overall it really is a nice phone."
164018,books,Very nice Book with awesome content .
158272,smartTv,The picture quality is good. However battery does not last too long if u r a heavy user otherwise battery is more or less ok.

135184,mobile,"I have been using this mobile for more than 5 days , I'll give my honest review CAMERA :The company claims it to be 48 MP but my brothers realme 3 pro's images are better. BATTERY : Guys don't be fooled by thinking it has a massive 6000 MAH battery , the backup is not up to the mark , and it takes 2.45 - 3.15 hours to charge DISPLAY : Maybe the only great thing in this phone GAMING : plays PUBG in HD , HIGH , not not as smooth as a phone with Snapdragon 710 CALL QUALITY : I don't know why many YouTube reviewers mention it, it appears to be the same in mostly all new devices , but there is one issue on this device guys , as the mobile heats up or ( background downloading , picking up a call in a middle of a game ) it becomes almost impossible to keep the mobile near the ear as the heat is very high . . My advice , buy this mobile if u want a mobile with good brand value or else please save your money."
121430,mobile,Everthing about this phone is good except the back glass which is not durable.the backglass shattered into pieces from simple fall in the car and apple asking to phone for whopping 53000 to change thephone my phone is just 20 days old
158743,mobile,The screen quality is really bad enough to break in the first fall. Previous Redmi 3s had fallen 100 times still the screen was intact. I replaced the screen which again broke without a fall.

The installation process was smooth and painless - we did not have to pay anything extra. The internet picture quality surpassed our expectations. Sound quality is good. The Set Top Box (we have a standard definition Tata Sky ...,) was decent enough. Yes there are a lot of app limitations, but workarounds exist in youtube how to's - will try them out for Prime and Netflix and get back. Hotstar works brilliant. Overall - for the price we paid - so far no complaints. Will Hope to update in a few weeks or months .., hopefully with more positive reviews."

When I watched reviews on YouTube every popular YouTuber told that it has a great battery backup and many things. When I used it for two days I'm very disappointed with this phone's battery backup my only purpose to purchase this phone because of its Monster size battery backup. It loosed my confidence about Samsung because first time I purchased any Samsung product and it ruins my dreams in just two days. My humble request to seller please replace this faulty product as soon as possible because I purchased this phone by requesting my father that this phone has a huge Monster size battery and now if my father know that battery backup was not as good as mentioned online and on YouTube channels, they will never trust on me in future and if I lost his trust then I'm unable to take any decision independently. Worst battery.......!"

152396,mobile accessories,"Pros: 1. Display quite smooth and pleasing. 2. Don't think about polycarbonate body, build is good. 3. Batery backup as compare to 5k is ok. Corns: 1. Don't get puzzled by youtube review, camera is just ok as it include AI, pixel is not clear but for social media it will do the job. 2. Design i think samsung followed the trend and other brand. My first notch display phone, thought it's gonna be ok, but trust me it looks really odd. 3. Speaker sound quality not good, not a bit loud, just a cheap sound like low budget phone. 4. Main thing where it comes to PUBG? You wont enjoy the gaming with the frame drop in balanced mode with medium frame rate. Lag is effective , lol the design is poor they have kept the speakar gaap in the bottom side so u will face interruption while gaming, the grip won't go easy as it have headphone jack also in the bottom- left. Which will definitely make u feel odd while gaming in loudspeaker or headphone. Even after 7days of use it has started to lag in basic/normal graphics with medium fram rate. I am a Samsung lover, where as i won't recommend you to waste money on this brand. They don't deserve the frame anymore. Only thing i have now is regret after purchase M30."

169389,mobile accessories,not bad
122837,mobile,"Excellent product and I have been using it every day and I must say the sound quality is really good and the build quality of the product is also very good. If u have rough and tough usage , u can have this product and noice cancellation is good but bass quality could be better at loud volumes but for everyday uses at this price point. It's really good product to invest our money."
139493,smartTv,It's an Indian Brand with good qualities within 30 to 40 k range. I have purchased this TV just four month back and it's working Fine with some small issue. I will advice to purchase this product to all my friends and those who are looking a good Smart TV Within 30 to 40 Range. Pathetic customer service.
157593,mobile accessories,"The fingerprint reader is not very accurate, ambient light sensor is also not very correct. The camera needs upgardes. Have seen better images with OP6 and 6T. The phone is very smooth and no lag while using. Dash charge is very good. Battery life on battery saver and mild to high usage lasts through the day."

156539,smartTv,TV doesn't respond all the time and abruptly keeps on hanging. The only respite in such cases is to remove the plug and restart all over again.
117598,smartTv,Best phone so far but its too heavy
124116,mobile,"First good Chinese product quality wise, user can decide their priority and brand however it's working absolutely fine and feels like using any premium phone. No heating, charging or hanging issue like Redmi. Use only it's own charger for fast charging and better performance, it will take 30minutes for full charging while other chargers may takes 2 hours."

125587,smartTv,Good
157528,mobile accessories,"The display grabbed my attention when I switched on the phone since it is a bezel less infinity v-display. The screen quality is actually good. Phone comes with a fast charger and a c-type cable which leads to fast charging which is the best thing. 5000 mAh battery which keeps the phone going on. The design of the phone is remarkable since it is a polycarbonate unibody which feels sturdy and solid while using the phone. It supports VOLTE for both the sims which makes it easier to switch data connection between two different sim. Ram distribution of done very nicely since it keeps the memory of the applications when switched and used after an interval. Unlike other dual camera phone this, phone comes with a secondary camera which helps to capture an image from a wider angle. In all a best phone in best price."
111357,mobile accessories,"After many comparisions and eliminations finally ordered this. Positives 1. Notch is awesome. 2.it looks like apple xs. Many friends surprised if I bought apple 3. Sound is great 4.pictures are good 5 no heat 6.speed is good Negetives 1 point - it is not light weight. Somewhat heavy 2. Face unlock is not instant 3. When you press power button you need to wait 20 sec to see the screen. 4 when your phone call is done, you need to wait till others cut the call as you may not see the screen immediately after phone call. 5 replaced my phone 2 times in Hope of solving 3 and 4. No use. So the product itself is corrupt not just my piece of phone 6 . Even after all kinds of troubleshoots by me and technician. Basic issues not solved. So returned my phone even though I love its features and looks , it has serious ‚Äôscreen goes blank' issues. We always click power button to unlock our phone.. but when you click power button it takes at least 20 seconds to show you screen.. just try to wait 20 seconds on any phone for unlock and if you are okay, this is the best phone in recent times in this budget. :-) all the best"
136341,mobile,"I mention the my personal experience in few points. 1. The weight of the phone which carry 6000 mAh battery is make my mind awesome. 2. I am really thankful to Samsung that they also give the Dolby atom sound. 3.camera of this phone is really smooth and the large view make the user's more happy than expected. 4. The click in camera is so fast and it captures the picture in that moment that user's want. 5.The slow and super slow motion video features is awesome. 6. The performance of camera, fingerprint sensors is best in this range of price phones. 7. The zoom of captured images is for better than realme phones. 8. I really happy that the fingerprint sensor is given in this phone with the all advanced features. My suggestion. 1. I want to say that no phone is perfect according to demand of user's minds. 2.the M30s have also needed some improvement specially in battery sector. 3. The fully charge battery of this phone is gone in just 30 hours use. 4. After that issues, the Samsung Galaxy M30s is create a history, it is the best phone this given price ever in the electronic device industry. Thank you for giving this opportunity and taking my personal experience. Your regards Vishal Gupta."
140500,mobile accessories,"Its been a month, I've been using this Samsung M30, I'd rate it 4/5, the fingerprint sensor works fine so does the face recognition. It has got 5000mah battery which is quite sufficient with the fast charging. The camera quality is not that good as compared to other phones in this range, especially the xiaomi ones."
162097,smartTv,Value for money.
132141,mobile,Great phone on great price
123932,mobile,"Fingerprint reader :Pics can be taken by touching finger print sensor, otherwise fingerprint sensor is good. Rear Camera:Day time pics are good. Night time pics sometimes not as expected. Front camera: I like the palm gesture to take the selfie, really fantastic. Battery: There are lot of apps which drains the battery so fast. The user has to disable or uninstall unwanted apps. I am moderate user and getting 2 days in one charge. Build quality and Appearance: Excellent,but feel little heavy due to large battery."
118895,mobile,Camera and battery quality is too bad. Others Mobile 3000Mah Battery is better than samsung M30s 6000 mah battery. After 9-10 hours i have to charged. Camera quality also too bad...

So please take complaint for return Many times i called to customer care but from that side i dint got any resolution of my return request.

The delivery was perfect. Packed very well. I was worried initially to order such costly stuff online. I was worried if it will be duplicate product. But, Amazon has put away all my worries. I got MacBook Air 2017 model at Rs.59,990/- which is even the best deal after a year. I am a Graphic Designer and use powerful tools like Adobe Illustrator. It delivers a very good performance. I love the battery life. And, it also charges super fast. I love my MacBook Air. :-)"

164423,smartTv,Very nice tv in small budget
131367,mobile,Got it for 16k with 6 GB ram and 128 GB storage I don't know why so many YouTuber complain about the battery life Well I think it's decent enough to last a day but alongside it's charging speed is fast enough Plus the performance is great to handle any sort of games be it PUBG or anything I can play PUBG at HD setting with medium frame rates and it will consume only about 10% of battery for a full 30 min session The camera is the greatest USP of the device photos are good enough in day or low light condition Overall a good product at a decent price
141573,smartTv,Lightning to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter is missing in the box. Please provide provide the missing accessory.
123085,smartTv,Excellent voice .....i like it.
160034,smartTv,This is the the most useful thing technology has offered ( to me ). I was a reader in childhood and that habit of reading was overcome by other things as I grew up. I havent read much since my schooltime to 21 Apr 2019.ie the day I received my kindle paper white. I have read 10 books on kindle in 40 days. This is one of the best buying decisions I have ever made. In love with my portable library.
150371,mobile,"Phone doesn't charge fast as mentioned (very slow). 40% only charged in 1.5 hrs. Turbo chargers are supposed to charge almost fully by that time. The battery also drains within a day even without playing high end games like pubg, asphalt, etc. The touch doesn't work seamlessly while playing games. Have to go out of the game or wait for few seconds for the touch to work again. Sound is very low compared to other phones. Alarm n ringtones are very feable. The good thing about this phone is the camera (wide angle option, selfie, photos) and video. I exchanged my previous Lenovo phone for an upgrade but now I feel that phone was better than this phone in every aspect And I believe Amazon/Samsung will not accept refund through their so called blancco app which has 1.8 star in play store. Feel like my money is wasted on this phone because of false hyped advertisement."
149680,mobile accessories,Overall it's good however uh will face issue in mic while playing game likes pubg recognition is not upto mark at that time. While calling it's works good. Battery is avg however
129712,mobile,Good product

160557,mobile,"This product is good but the material doesn't feel durable. Noise cancellation is good. Sound quality is good. Using since few months working fine, I'm just worried about the material quality."
133900,mobile,I am using the new Samsung M30s since last 5 days. And it is the best phone so far in the mid-range. I have used Redmi Note 7 for past few months but M30s is the ultimate killer. Pros: The super amoled screen gave me the best experience ever for watching movies and videos. Battery backup is next level. Detailing in photos shot by this monster is marvelous. U can see every minute thing in the pic. The dual tone back gives a premium look. Moreover the round edges at the back gives a perfect hold in hand as comapred to redmi note 7 which was slippery. Few things which could have been improved: No Notification LED No earphones in-box No backcover in-box Overall this one is the best phone in this segment.
124998,mobile accessories,Good

Jeff Keller has done a yeoman service in covering such a great concept in words so economical even those people always cribbing about lack of time will find this book stupendous and awesome. It needs to be read several times to understand the import of this philosophy and its worth the effort. I read somewhere that "" Bad attitude is like a burst tyre which requires replacement if we have to move forward"" and this book epitomizes that concept. Attitude is a small thing if changed can result into a tremendous benefit."

If you are tight budget and only want a mobile for normal use (can't say for games like pubg because i haven't tested it) then you can go for it. Camera is good, battery backup is just awesome.

156936,mobile,"The Redmi 6 pro comes with excellent features as all are mentioned in the website. Firstly thanks to amazon to deliver the product within 2 days. Secondly MIUI 10 interface is awesome.It is not possible to explain here without using it practically. Thirdly screen split option allow users to use multiple applications simultaneously which is an awesome experience. Fourthly face unlock feature can sence your face almost in a dark environment. But two important things are needs to be addressed that future buyers of this phone should be concerned about, 1. Picture quality of front camera as not good as website claims. 2. No OTG cable is provided by mi. User needs to buy it separately."

111533,mobile accessories,Again.... A GREAT product by Huawei
123867,mobile accessories,Fingerprint Reader :- It is kinda slow sometimes it takes up to 2-3 sec to read your fingerprint... Camera Quality :- it's camera is good gives clear image but somewhat disappointing not as good as I expected... Battery life :- this is one thing about this phone that I can say with full certainty that I am satisfied with my phone's battery life now I don't have to charge my phone 2-3 times a day (even I use my phone all day or gaming all day) Looks :- it's look is quite appealling (Slim and triple rear camera back dark blue look)... But I think they should add one double tap feature to close screen without using power button (it prevent power button from getting damaged)...

132965,smartTv,Have been using the product for more than an year. Battery life is good. I was always worried if the battery dies within 1 year then I wouldn't be able to use the speaker. But so far nothing like that. Sometimes I have left it for charging overnight but no problems as well. Sound quality is decent. Only thing missing is woofer which obviously this product doesn't offer...
137231,mobile,"I would like to highlight few issues which I observed compared to other mobiles although it's better for the price he is giving. 1. If I click on any link, it takes through MI browser instead of chrome and I did not see option to select chrome as default browser it's a big pain. Very very difficult to uninstall MI apps by general public, he should have knowledge on how software works in order to uninstall. 2. Max volume & Brightness is less when compared to other mobiles. 3. Display clarity is little low even when compared with Lenevo K6 Power. 4. New work reception & net speed is 20% less. 5. Lot of times finger unlock is not working. 6. Bluetooth signal breaks if mobile placed in back picked it has become a pain while Jogging and cycling. 7. Display size is not what we imagine before buying, few notifications on top centre hidden as speaker and sensor r placed in display."

135332,mobile accessories,"I have never written a product review but this phenomenal device made me do this. So, in a 14k mobile device, you expect ""x"" but this phone gives u 3x of everything that u wanted. Battery- trust me, i was skeptical about the 5k mah until i used it on day one. I am a Very heavy user (100-200 calls/day, Watsapp,office email,fb, Instagram etc till i go to bed) and 100% charge at 9am in mng reaches only 40% after 12-14 hr of usage. Camera-auto focus, front cam, depth etc. Works good. However, i found some pixelation at zoom. Not sure if m using it incorrectly or its a Device issue. Display- phenomenal, amazing Samsung is class apart from similar range competitive products. Supeb clarity and u notch makes it look premium. Gaming- ASPHALT 9 is working smooth. I didn't load many games but benchmark is asphalt so u can decide. Heating problem- not at charging, 30+ minute on ASPHALT makes u feel the warmth. Not bothering though. Processor- toggling between screens is smooth, machine response is great. sadly, no NFC. Will update review after 1 month of usage."

Never lags even with multiple apps open , call clarity is great . Only thing i have found wrong is that finger print reader is around 2 or 3 micro seconds slow . Thats the only thing . Have not done heavy gaming like nova 3 , moderate games fare very well .even if u keep on playing for 3 hours straight and the phone doesnt get heat up or all. I havent used the camera that much so i cant comment on that aspect. Overall its a steal at this price. Would have preferred the stock android experience but hey you cant have it all"

165564,mobile,"With Gorilla glass on the back, it looks fantastic. Feels good to use, gives premium feel. No one believed this costs under 15k. Display too is lovely with Puredisplay or not, it doesn't hurt my eyes even when reading for longer duration and the colors really pop. Battery lasts 24 hours easily. Takes nearly 2 hours to charge 0 to 100% . I mostly use chrome to read and occasional WhatsApp, Quora, calls, social media. 3500 mAH doesn't look inadequate at all. Camera is good for the price. Automatically adjusts camera mode based on subject/scene, and has raw format mode. 4K video looks clean when looked in laptop (not pixelated), has decent colors too. There is no lag as such, but I felt animations are not fluent at times, especially after deleting few SMS messages, other messages are not sliding up smoothly at times. Played few games and didn't find any issues there. Easy to switch between recent apps (5-7 apps) as it doesn't reload the apps. Non-stock android phones I used in the past always reloaded apps which was unpleasant. Pros: - HDR display is great, which you cannot realise until you see it. - Glass on the back is attractive. Reflects enough light (more than display) to comb my hair when needed :) - No nonsense bloatwares, clean stock android. - Better signal reception than my old Redmi phone. - Smooth to touch/type. - Good camera for the price. - Clean 4K video. Minor cons: - With glass on the back and since camera has a decent bump, it sometimes slips from the surface where I rest it. But no problem when holding it, never slips out of hand. - I would love a slow charging option, since I plan to use this for years I don't want to fast-charge it and lose battery life. Performance is smooth, and looks awesome. Am happy with this phone."
117056,mobile accessories,"Best iPhone I‚Äôve used. Sold my one plus 6 and got this one. The screen is not an OLED so you miss out on deep blacks and saturation. But I noticed the colours are better than the older iPhones with LCD. It also has thick bezels which take some time to get used to. An OLED screen on this would‚Äôve been wonderful but apple being apple wont do that! When it comes to software, iOS is simple the best. You get a lot less features but almost everything works smooth and perfect unlike android. My old phone had a ton of features like gesture controls which rarely ever worked. There‚Äôs a lot of attention to detail in small bits like animations and haptic feedback in iOS. Daily used apps like whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit have better optimisation than android. Introduction of haptic feedback feels very natural in these apps This makes it feel premium. Also iOS is miles ahead than android when it comes to touch response and software understanding. I can type twice as fast on this than android phones. The phone is clever enough to understand unintentional touches on the screen. These things used to annoy me a lot on android. This is one of the main reasons I switched back to iPhone. Typing on iOS is way better no matter which keyboard app you get from play store. Also, Gesture navigation is very smooth. Nothing comes close. I really like how apple has designed the software to handle the notch. Surprisingly the notch on this doesn‚Äôt bother me as much as the one plus 6 did, even though it is much larger in size. It‚Äôs mainly because they didn‚Äôt try to cram it with a dozen icons. Well balanced stereo speakers are a good addition to the phone. You get true stereo imaging without any ear fatigue in just one ear over long period of usage. Camera is one of the best you get in the market right now though pixel 3 takes better pictures in low light. Video shooting is the best on any phone. Camera is the same as iPhone XS without optical zoom and taking portrait of objects or pets. Portrait mode only works for human faces. Battery life is great. Easily lasts me more than a day. In fact it‚Äôs better than iPhone XS and XS Max. There‚Äôs no fast charging but I‚Äôm fine with it since I charge my phone over night. There is no 3D Touch on this one but they‚Äôve added haptic touch which covers control centre toggles, moving the cursor on keyboard and lock screen actions. Only thing you‚Äôre missing out on is shortcuts on home screen and peek and pop. Dual sim seems to work fine. Been using Vodafone and Jio (e sim) Build quality seems alright. I would recommend getting a sturdy case since the phone is covered in glass. Overall it‚Äôs an amazing phone. It is a lot more expensive than phones like one plus, pixel 3a, galaxy s10e and has less specs to offer on paper but the software makes up for it. The price you‚Äôre paying is for the unmatched software integration. If you‚Äôre coming from an old iPhone, go for it! You won‚Äôt be disappointed! If you care more about an OLED screen, portrait mode for pets and objects and 3D Touch, go for iPhone XS or XS Max. Personally I don‚Äôt think they are worth 40-50k extra for just these 3 features."

But the phone charges very fast also. 0 to 100 in less than two hours. Phone is perfect if app lock doesn't matter for you and battery also.

133816,mobile accessories,"I am reviewing this after 5 days of usage: I personally recommend for high-usage with Long-life battery. I can give full 5 star for battery life. I got this mobile on Sunday in great Indian sale. I used for half day and charged on Monday morning 100% with normal usage(FB, WhatsApp, calls) it was 15% on Wednesday which is more than enough for smart phone. Camera is 48Mega pixel very good rear camera. I will go by my personal rating as below Camera -4.5/5 Display - 3.5/5(there is some line back at Edge can't see some details) Battery -5/5 Look 4.7/5 User interface - 5/5 Sound 3.5/5 Totally worth if you purchase not more than 12,500"

Sound: fair enough Display: 5 out of 5 It really surprise you that the display is quite smooth Delivery: 5 out of 5 I got this item within 2 hours. Amazing delivery by Amazon Prime Now. So the overall rating is 5 as almost all features are great. Also the price which I got was great.

Not working in Weak Signal as compare to other phone, everytime disconnected and have to manually configuring it, usually I used maximum for Internet. Front Camera is good but Rear camera is inferior. FingerPrint reader, Face Recognition and Battery is excellent. Overall built and function is good as Processing speed, Loudspeaker, HD screen and video quality. I will give Three Star and Price is little bit High it should be around Rs.12000."

Build is very good, feels like a premium device. Use the transparent case though~Glass Back. 3. Speaker is loud, Call quality is crisp, No Dolby Atmos, u can't have everything in this price. 4. Network reception way better than others. 5. Android One: Already updated to September Security Patch. Android 10 guaranteed. 5. Now, DISPLAY: 720p AMOLED, Look closely and U ll notice the black dots, Display could have been brighter too. (Using S8 & S10, so easy to notice the lowered resolution) Not a deal breaker if your priorities are timely updates, battery life, premium build, great call and audio quality. Not a letdown for me. Loved the device. Go for it."

159801,mobile accessories,"This is my first phone from Apple. I was in confusion in buying between pixel and iphone. Even though pixel is far superior than apple in all departments, I went for iphone due to craziness. The product is well packed and delivered. When I started using the phone, the screen looks average, battery is good and the hardware seems good. The camera disappoints me al lot. Never expect this from Apple. In particular, the front camera is worst, in indoor lightning conditions and can see dots in image like a VGA camera. At a cost of 60k, I was more so curious about the camera. It disappoints me badly. Even my motorola camera works well. If you are crazzy for the brand, go for it. Else definitely, you can go for other models in the market."

135325,mobile accessories,I have mainly two concerns with the phone First is about its display quality since the first day of use I am experiencing a yellowish white screen not full white display seems like dull white I dont know it's happening only with my phone or any other mi a3 phones and second is hybrid sim slot not able to insert both sim and memory card. Lastly price should be 10999 instead of 12999 Camera perfect

137100,mobile,"I was looking for a phone with the best battery performance, with easy to use UI, I am feeling very happy that, Samsung has provided best with this class. and Amazon is provided the best deal and product delivery. Thanks to both of these. This is my first ever experience with SAMSUNG and Feeling best for the right choice This phone not only giving a smooth daily task performance, even better camera quality. before I bought this product, I had been to go through so many Youtubers reviews of all kinds. Even After all this, When I use this phone, believe me It is awesome in this category. I liked best with this phone are Battery performance The Super AMOLED screen experience is great in class, and providing adequate brightness, best Night mode, blur light filter One UI integration with best of android, easy to use and making daily life easy. Even Best 3.5mm Jack is back, Cheers SAMSUNG lovers. Like to add, User has to be more careful with this phone specially for the screen, and use of case cover and screen guard help you to protect this phone from damage. If Samsung provides case cover then, What is better than this!!!! The expectation from SAMSUNG, I am eagerly waiting for Upgrade with ONE UI based on Android 10"

154277,mobile,"Since 2015, I have used many different phones like Samsung, Gionee, Lava, Panasonic, Redmi , Micromax, Nokia and Intex but there is not any close comparision i can find in all these with Apple. My first Apple set was 4S which I bought as second handset from one of my brother, but trust me that old phone is best than any other phone I used in my life until I bought 6S."
166283,smartTv,Worst quality .low sound quality
110391,smartTv,4‚≠êÔ∏è
136292,smartTv,I loved this tv.. It has great picture quality.. Make sure you've a high speed connection when you stream 4k or HD content in Netflix/youtube because otherwise it'll look pixelated and Pixelated picture in 4k TV will look worse than a normal TV. It's running android 8.0 after a 700MB update. There's no prime video app available in Playstore.. You can side load it but the prime app for android tv is really bad and probably will ruin your expectation.. I'll be using my firestick to access the prime service till they make the app better
111931,refrigerator,All very good
135407,mobile accessories,I have purchased these headphones for my brother and he is currently using it but when I used these earphones I found that the bass is not that much good it is ok ok for listening songs on the go but if you are expecting something very powerful or something appreciable it is not in that League although it is quite comfortable to wear but you have to compromise the quality of song with the comfort..... that's what I feel.... show my birth date is if you want to have a comfort of wearing light earphones or headphones then it is a good bye but if you wish to have something good for listening to I would not suggest it !!
115302,mobile,Bateery taken high consumption

Heats on downloading larger files like pubg .No display protection, as many other manufacturers give in same price range"

139959,mobile accessories,"It's not worth purchasing. The phone hangs very frequently despite the fact that its internal memory has more than enough space, not more than 10 apps have been installed, not even being used for gaming, no time to see videos etc. Xiaomi has been deteriorating the quality of its products rapidly. I have decided not to buy Mi phone anymore."

131002,mobile,Good stuff. Support my Mi A2 Phone. But the cost is bit high.
160343,mobile accessories,This phone is just awesome. Am finding it very comfortable. Samsung has come up with this Monster Battery which is just superb. I use it as my primary source for internet and end of the day the battery is 70% still. I used Redmi phones and my sister uses Oppo/ Vivo phones. Samsung proves that the brand is far better in performance. I don't see the heating up issues and hanging problems.
127186,mobile,Good

Almost having the quality flagship device display. No network drop issues found yet. Using since 5 days. Bought 128gb+6gb Ram version. Very smooth and for gamers a best device for playing any HD game. Gorilla glass 3 is a bit dissapointment but if you use a good Tempered glass that is fine too.
144854,mobile accessories,Nice camera and display battery profomnce awesome thanks realme u1
110014,mobile,"""No matter whichever phone comes into market, Vivo, oppo, realme, redmi, etc... Old is and will be gold forever..."" Comparing these brands with samsung, is simply a baseless thing. Some people won't like it's camera because samsung gives real pictures just like our eyes and the people today are much more interested in edited photographies whick can provide them with an edited face of theirs. Using this phone since 2 weeks. Battery: I could never even have imagined that an android phone can give a battery back up for even more than 2 days."

161526,mobile,Using Samsung for the first time The most adorable thing about Samsung m30s is its display 6000 mah battery is not up to the mark My asus zenfone max with 5000 mah battery gives more usage time than m30s 6000 mah battery Camera is fine but did not meet the expectations Device is getting heated while playing pubg.

162369,mobile,"Very Good product, satisfied with the quality and using regularly for my own. Delivery also very good, in time and the behavior of delivery executive is very good. Appreciate Amazon."
152407,mobile,Pros: 1. Stock android. Smooth and intuitive. 2. Camera performance is great in daylight conditions 3. It supports fast charging. Initial charging speed is decent. 4. Fingerprint scanner at the back is quick enough and very accurate. 5. Battery life is decent. 3-4 hrs of onscreen time. (Real life usage: 24hrs+) Cons: 1. The charging speed declines significantly after 50% charge. 2. Background blur effect is hit or miss (sometimes). 3. No head phone jack. USB-C dongle (provided as an accessory within box) or bluetooth headphone is must. 4. Wobbles when placed on flat surface due camera bump. Overall verdict: You will love it if you seek stock android experience and adjust your expectation to sub 20K segment phone.
136077,books,I liked the packaging much. Book is awesome. Great Books comes from Great Writer like Napoleon Hill

121663,mobile,Everything is fine... but the cable to charge is too small.... seems my issue is a trivial one but in many cases it‚Äôs a miserable experience... please do mention such things...
138260,mobile,"It features a new style triple-camera module and new color options. The back is still made of glossy plastic, and it attracts fingerprints/ smudges easily. Having said that, Samsung has done a good job in keeping the weight down (188 grams) despite a massive 6,000mAh battery. Coming to the display, there is no change in the M30s' 6.4-inch Super AMOLED panel. It still looks nice and offers full-HD+ (1080 x 2340 pixels) resolution with Infinity U notch. I had no problem with its touch performance, brightness levels, sunlight legibility and viewing angles. Battery lasted for me for 1.5 days for my daily use. Both cameras performed over an average for its price and competition. In the daylight condition, the rear camera does outshines with the 48-megapixel lens. Also, the wide-angle camera does a good job. The Galaxy M30s works well in handling day-to-day tasks."

166040,smartTv,"Worst customer service. It has been only 1 month since we purchased this and we are having issues with display. It gets stuck for 1-2 minutes straight and lags very often. The sound is also not very impressive and apps like amazon prime video have really worst audio quality. We have filled a complain and it has been almost 10 days, no one has arrived. The Service centre keeps rescheduling but they never send the engineer. Consoles also lags, you cannot play games on PS4 as it does not plays smooth and lags. Overall in Conclusion; dont buy this piece of crap. Although the cheap price may delude you, but go for some other company."

118409,mobile,"Bought it the very next day of its launch. It's been 4 days of usage. And here are my experiences in the form of Pros and Cons. PROS 1. Awesome battery: Being a blogger and bookstagrammer,I need to stay online through out the day and the battery of this smartphone has been outstanding...was almost 70% even after rigorous use. 2.No heating problem...touchwood. 3.Loved the saphhire blue color and finish. 4.Convenient and comfortable grip,gives a nice feel. 5. Good display: provides a rich,full screen display. 6.Good Dolby Sound: Being a music lover,I prefer listening music while working for my blog and have always loved the sound system of Samsung smartophones and I'm satisfied this time too. 7. Great front and triple rear camera at Rs13999: It's camera was the main reason for me purchasing it as I needed a good camera phone for my blogging and I'm satisfied...ofcourse don't expect DSLR effect in your pics but yes,pics are really nice. 5.Great processor,no lags. 6.I bought the 4GB+64 GB one as I needed smartphone for blogging on the go and it is able to fulfill my blog requirements. For my personal calls,I have Samsung Galaxy C7 Pro and it has been working brilliantly even after 18 months of purchase 6.I got Rs 1000 cashback plus Rs 500 of voucher benefits too so to me its cost was Rs12499. CONS: 1.No LED notification,flash notification instead. 2. No earphones. Since it's been just 4 days of usage,so I experienced these two lackings only and I'm hoping not to come across any more...keeping my fingers crossed. Will update my review if I found anything more worth adding to it. VERDICT: A GO FOR IT SMARTPHONE YOU WILL NEVER REGRET PURCHASING IN THIS PRICE RANGE."

111403,mobile accessories,After the price drop this is probably the best phone you can get. Totally worth it. Got the rs.6000 cashback and exchange for previous phone. Normal phone users wont be able to tell at all that the display is low res. Best battery life in an iphone till date and the a12 bionic chip is freaking fast.

136861,mobile accessories,I think in the low budget mobiles the Samsung M series is the best series. Samsung galaxy M20 is the best mobile under 12000 range. The v infinity display is given awesome look. The camera is super. Quality of images are too good. The wide angle given you a awesome picture. The battery life is just awesome the 5000mah battery given you 1.5 to 2 day battery life. The Samsung processor is too good . After using of 3 months i would say the mobile is overall awesome in budget .
124210,mobile accessories,First one week the produt was working good but after that there is battery issue when even there is 40% battery it tells us tht battery low nd it will off directly waist product i received and after one month the product stopped working waste of money dont buy guyssss

Here are quick words: PERFORMANCE System hangs, apps freezes, Screen becomes unresponsive It's not an exception once a while but it happens too frequently. 1/5 CAMERA Not impressive but manageable. 3/5 FINGERPRINT SENSOR Most erratic part of the phone is its fingerprint sensor. Takes a while to unlock the phone. 1/5 DISPLAY Impressive considering the price point 4/5 OS Biggest let down is MIUI.

139810,mobile,"It's hard to write reviews about iconic, and commercially successful products, like the iPhone, because it is unlikely that we will be able to find something to write - that has not already been written about. Nonetheless, the perspective of a rating changes, when the price-point of a product changes. The fact that the 6S is today available at a price at which the 5S used to be sold 2 years ago, does make one look at this phone differently. For those (like me) who are loyalists of timeless & classic design masterpieces from Nokia (N-Series, Lumia 9XX), Apple (5-series), and HTC (One-series) the iPhone 6/7-series design changes were a sacrilege, that tantamount to succumbing in to mass-market needs. However, look beyond that, and the iPhone 6S is still as beautifully crafted as all iPhones are, and it is hard to find any flaws per se. And for those of us, who care more about what's under the hood, rather than the shell, the relative price difference between the 6 and the 6S is worth it. Personally, I like the marginally thicker design of the 6S, as it gives the phone some much-needed heft, as well as the necessary psychological reassurance of eliminating any fears of Bendgate, that battered the iPhone 6's image. Build quality and craftsmanship continue to be top notch. The improvement in responsiveness & performance is evident, especially if you are upgrading from a 2-year old 5S, as is the improvement in the quality of the Retina display. I also think that the form factor of 4.7"" screen strikes the right balance between readability & usability; and is therefore another step in the right direction. The higher resolution front-facing camera is a much-needed fix for today's selfie-obsessed generation, and irons out one of the key weaknesses of the old phone. Needless to say, the increase in RAM to 2GB, is also reassuring, as it increases the perceived life of the phone, given that apps will continue to become more & more memory intensive. Not that 1GB RAM was ever inadequate for the 5-series, because the beauty of iOS (like Windows Phone) lay in the fact that it is, by design, a far more resource-efficient Operating System, when compared to Android. On the whole, a worthy buy for those who don't care much about flaunting the latest & biggest, especially at the price-points it is now available at. And yes, most women, like my wife, will tend to like the Rose Gold variant :-)"

In every 5 mins it's showing no sim inserted. After restart only again sim card is being detected. Very bad experience. Signal strength is also very low.
111519,mobile accessories,After using this phone for 3 weeks here are some pros and cons. Pros:- 1.The battery is really great . I don't remember of hearing any beeps of battery low on this phone . On continous usage you can expect the phone to last for 15+ hours. I remember that once even on single charge the battery lasted for 2 days on regular usage. 2. The processor is really good for gaming. 3. This phone doesn't hang unlike my old Samsung galaxy j5. 4. Camera is really good for wide angle shots. 5. Fingerprint sensor is also very fast. 6. Connecting to other devices is also really good with this device. 7. Display quality is really great. Cons:- 1. Face lock is a bit slow. 2. The front camera for selfie is not as good. But not that much concern after all.

137034,smartTv,"I wanted to buy a tv with good 4k quality. Before buying one, I scoured through different brands and their models, but none of them were up to my satisfaction. But when I came across Shinco TV, what attracted me was its sound and picture quality which was better than the other established brands within this budget.This tv has inbuilt sound bar which provides it a refined and powerful sound. Some reviews stated that the remote control accompanied with the tv drains the battery within few hours, but it's been three months I've been using it and never faced a problem. However, some shortcomings that I feel are worth rectifying are that sensible is not that useful. Other than that, bluetooth connectivity would have been a good and useful feature. The tv does not support Dolby sound system, so you might be watching HD channels without audio. That's rectified by changing settings on your dth system. In total, it's a 9 out of ten for me."

158150,mobile,"The phone is simply perfect! I'll cover all the aspects of the phone one by one in detail. First of all the Super Amoled screen is very immersive. The brightness of this phone is on another level. Refresh rate too is satisfactory. I compared my phone with One Plus 7 and my phone certainly won in almost every aspect. The second feature which attracts everyone was its humongous battery life. 6000 mAh! And Samsung certainly kept its promise. The battery can go on and on doesn't matter if you play Pubg or any other game or just use your phone for calling or photography or anything, you can use it whole day after one charge. The fast charging too is very good and it charges the phone at a pretty decent speed(my phone won over One Plus 7 in this aspect too). The system GUI is very much user friendly and Samsung keeps giving security and software updates. The back mounted fingerprint sensor is faster than any Realme device and quite reachable too as compared to Samsung's earlier models. The camera quality is just amazing and it offers a whole lot of variations in your photos and videos. You can record slo-mo and even super slow motion videos from this device. It automatically edits and gives a clean output which is presentable and eye catching too. The photo quality and wide angle lens is quite impressive. Selfie camera too is satisfiable, providing numerous features to take a pic. Taking about the processor, it gives maximum output, the phone really NEVER EVER HANGS! Pubg or any other heavy game runs smoothly on this device. No heating issues after 7 hrs of continuous playing(its battery literally lasted even more!), No lagging issues, no frame drop, Pubg ran in full HD quality and without any issues. The phone is completely packed with the beloved 3.5mm audio jack and type C. I don't know how Samsung managed to put all this in a phone and even after that kept its price under 20K. According to me no MI or One Plus phone can compete even nearly with this phone, Apple is anyway out of the race. On a scale of 1-100 I'll give this phone 110 marks! Super satisfied by its performance. Loved it completely. Would strongly suggest to me peer group or anyone about to buy a phone. An amazing work done by Samsung and also Amazon as I got it the 3rd day after delivery even after I bought it in a flash sale. Delighted to have this phone with me. ^_^"
141932,mobile accessories,Little boring interface and as it is new model and less people are trying this.. many apps are not designed as per its screen view hence creating problem sometimes but rest is good.

Charging happens for 2-3 min and red light got switch off. When tried to use it in one minute blue light switec to red light and after another minute it gets switched off. Don't know why JBL, such a brand in the world of speakers, make these faulty products. As I read in the reviews most people got their money worth(which I also got for one year) but now it's completely waste. Please stop doing this to customers."
155392,smartTv,"Such a disgusting service by Amazon.they delivered a defeactive smartphone.It hans a lot. Battery is draining fast.

161465,mobile,Used this product for 7-8 months and it suddenly stopped working. The build quality was amazing but the sound was average. The bass quality is okayish compared to sennheiser but the bass can be tweaked using applications. I ordered this earphones considering the brand recognition of JBL but was hugely disappointed. If you are looking for something for overall good music experience you can give this a try but I feel the price is a bit High considering its durability.

112757,mobile,An absolute killer in this price segment. Samsung has really outdone themselves with this M30s. Totally impressed with the weight distribution considering the phone packs an enormous 6000mah battery. The m30s also delivers an outstanding display. The large screen coupled with the 'mega' battery makes an delightful streaming experience. The overall camera performance is pretty decent but it lacks in low light performance . The wide angle shots was dark and full of noises. The edge detection for live focus is slightly off. m30s handles multitasking with no interpretations. And even prolonged use didn't lead to any heating issues. The fingerprint sensor is quite fast and responsive. The sapphire blue variant gives a jazzy appeal
157607,mobile,"The first drawback about the phone is,it don't have separate audio jack, u have to use the connecter provided to connect to the USB ie,u can't use ur earphones while charging. The second drawback of the phone is it's battery life, when using mobile data, it's getting drained at Avery faster rate."

158661,mobile,"The promised features for Samsung M30s are really fascinating. But does it really keep them? Here is what I have experienced so far using the phone for 7 days : 1. Charging : full charge in 2 hours 35 minutes or more, sometimes 1% in 3 minutes, charger and phone both heating 2. The battery back up : less than a 4000 mah battery, not acting like a 6000 mah battery phone, keeping screenlight 15% okay otherwise battery-draining 3. Camera images : image quality no way 48 mega pixel, Change in colour, blurry images on zoom, difference in colour when in wide-angle view, selfie images not up to the mark 4. Camera videos : video recording nice, better than capturing images. 5. Display : nice, great experience while watching YouTube videos 6. Processor : fast and nice 7. Screentouch : very comfortable and smooth 8. Network speed : nice, lack of network-speed meter 9. Sound : volume enough for use, lack of bass quality 10. Sound recording : very nice, no noise found in recording 11. Build quality : very nice, back panel in opal-black colour charming, required back-cover protection, feeling good in hand 12. Network : good I wanted this phone only because of its monster battery-capacity, I find myself not satisfied at all. I don't know why the battery is not up to the mark. I can't say if there is any difference in the battery back-ups of this phone's 4GB ram & 6GB ram versions. I hope my honest and unbiased review will help customers here, Amazon India and Samsung for their further actions. Thank you!"

119328,smartTv,"Camera quality is good. But, image is too polished. Charging is fast- Full charge in 1 hour and will last all day. Don't know if it's is water resistant or can survive drop test like Moto phones. Too many Mi notifications, pop ups, recommendations, still figuring out how to disable them. No headset. Charger and Phone cover is provided. Insert sim only even mobile is switched off. There is call recording, notes feature as well. Easy to read Jio mags or news article."

124228,refrigerator,"First things first, don't forget to download MI fit app and sync it with the band before you use it. This is the second band that I picked up to gift. I have the Honour Band as well, so when I can compare, I know that more or less both have the same features except for the fact that Honour has a colored LED display. Let me list the pros and cons of the band. Pros: - Clear display on the 0.75"" OLED screen - Better battery life in comparison to Honour 4 and Fast Track Reflex - Easy to understand functionalities. - Almost accurate counting of steps and heart rate sensor. ( I used two bands together and it was showing the same rate) - You will get the notifications on your phone only if you have enabled the same on your phone. For ex, I could not figure why I wasn't getting the watsapp notifications on my phone till I realised that I had turned off the notifications on my phone for a couple of apps. - Idle alert - When you're too busy and lose track of time, the band will vibrate, reminding you to get up and take a walk. Con's - Wasn't sure of the sleep tracking. The reading showed different in two activity trackers. - Wasn't able to sync the caller option with the tracker. - Not a very good visibility outdoors in comparison to Honour 4. The new Mi Band 3 also comes with a long-lasting battery that lasts up to 20 days. The Mi Band 3 also has additional features like locate your phone, sleep analysis, stopwatch, quiet mode shuffle, weather forecast etc."

The fire TV 4k is best in the market I guess so, because I am viewing all pictures from prime videos/youtube in 4k resolution. Even a normal LED TV will transform into 4k experience. Alexa - voice recognition made commanding easier in search of information in the internet world. My kid loves Alexa, because it responds with info/pictures/audio/video.

143324,smartTv,"My 4-year old JBL Flip had some battery issues, and apparently battery replacement is not an option. So I decided to upgrade, and found myself stuck between the JBL Flip 4 and the Charge 3. Eventually I went with the Flip 4 only because it was cheaper, and the decision paid off. I received the speaker just the day after ordering it. No hassle. The following review is from the perspective of a layman. No jargon, no excessive detail. In the box: speaker, charger cable, documentation. Speaker comes with a removable lanyard that you can use to hang it from somewhere (for example, shower head in the bathroom) Charger cable is Micro USB to USB 2.0 - it does NOT come with a wall adapter, though. Fit and finish of the speaker is quite good. Just from a cursory look, you can tell that this speaker is immune to splashes. The rubberised ends of the speaker make sure that it stays stable even when booming bass would rattle it. This was a big flaw in the first gen Flip that JBL has thankfully addressed. Turn on the speaker and you will be greeted with a cheery sound. Just below the power button is an array of tiny LEDs that function as a battery level indicator. Connecting to phone/laptop is a breeze. All you have to do is press the bluetooth button on the speaker, search for the speaker in the phone/laptop, and connect. The speaker chirps once to indicate a device is connected. And then the fun begins. Performance at low volumes is quite good across the range. Bass is not too loud, and neither is treble. So your audio will not get distorted. At moderate volumes, the bass stands out greatly. Use the speaker in your bathroom and see what I mean. If you like bass-heavy tracks, use this speaker in the bathroom and you will have no complaints. Charge time is quite good - I got from zero dots to four in about 3 hours. Pros: 1. Sound quality is great - maybe not the best, but definitely very good for a speaker in this price range. 2. Build quality is very good - tested the speaker by immersing it in a bucket of water and it faced no issues whatsoever. Buttons have a nice crisp feel to them, no need to use lots of force. 3. Speaker can be paired with over 100 other (compatible) speakers at the touch of a button (the JBL Connect+ button mentioned earlier.) Ultimately, the device is simple, no-frills, intuitive, and a joy to use. Cons: 1. Bass at medium volumes can drown out the rest of the music, especially in a bathroom. I listen to a lot of music with less bass, and having the bass amplified kills the feel of the music. 2. Charging cable does not come with a wall adapter, meaning you have to charge it from a laptop or power bank (or use a different wall adapter.) Mercifully, the pin is the standard Micro USB that most android phones today use, which means the cable is not that much of an issue."

Voice recognition is decent, say 15-20 small steps away it does recognize. Smart speaker for budget friendly customers. The max volume could have been higher. Vol 10 is max and it not very loud, good for a mid-size living room. Need additional speakers for party. Limited amazon music collection and many songs may not be in the list. Also, you need to keepp it on charge at all times to use it, no battery option available at the moment."

112916,smartTv,"Apple iPhone 7 Plus Size: 32 GB Colour: Glossy black Here i am going to write a full -lengthy review,I write everything which i found in this Phone. Best For if you Excuse the Price. -WHATS IN THE BOX- ================== 1. THE IPHONE 7 PLUS ITSELF 2. THE LIGHTNING EARPODS 3. LIGHTNING TO 3.5 MM JACK CONVERTOR 4. LIGHTNING TO USB CABLE 5. POWER ADAPTER 6. SIM EJECTOR PIN Design :- First up, Apple has added two new colours to the arsenal of Apple iPhone 7 Plus. Black (which gives the iPhone a matte black finish) and Jet Black (a glossy black, which I used) editions have been added. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus has a 5.5-inch Retina full HD (1080p) display with ion-strengthened glass on top, taking most of the prime area on the front of the phone. The hard press home key at the bottom has been replaced by a Taptik, pressure sensitive button. This can be customized (for the right Taptik effect) at the time of first boot or later from the settings menu. ------------------------------------- Performance:- The Apple iPhone 7 Plus is now dust and water resistant with IP67 certification. It makes sense to have this feature in an expensive phone. it has an A10 Fusion chipset (running 2.23 GHz quad-core CPU), 3 GB RAM and is available with 32, 128 and 256 GB storage options Apple iPhone 7 Plus comes with the new iOS 10 pre-loaded. There are lot of improvements in the software department. These include a redesigned notification tray and a smarter keyboard with intelligent suggestions. Improvements to Photos, Music and News apps can also be seen. Siri seems to be better in the new operating system and does take commands faster, with almost accurate voice recognition. Wireless Charging:- Wireless charging can be listed as one of the biggest iPhone 7 pros comparing iPhone 6S with iPhone 7 among iPhone 7 reviews. As Galaxy S6/S6 Edge+ takes leading step of wireless charging, iPhone 7 is loath to lag behind, embracing wireless charging technology with a maximum distance of 15 feet. It makes things easier for daily charging of iPhone 7 without being bothered of finding charge cable and free up lightning port for music playback. Here are some Pros and Cons of the Iphone 7Plus ADVANTAGES or Pros of this Phone :- 1. 3GB RAM,32GB internal and 64-bit MT6735 P chipset with speed of 1.3GHz Gives you Finest experience in Iphones. 2. Camera Quality is awesome-Beyond the Expectation. Even you Can Record 4K Video at 30fps. You have a direct 2x zoom without any compromise of quality of the photo. 3. Big Screen 5.5 inch doesn't feel large in Hand, Feel very compatible. and with 1920x1080 resolution. you'll be completely satisfied. 4. You Pay 70K and Now You receiving a durable Device with Splash, water and dust resistant. 5. Battery is Now 2900mAh that Enough for iphones . It's takes 6-8 Hours of Continues use to drain it. 6. It come with Latest IOS 10 , With A lot of New features and with Powerful security. 7. Siri is upgraded and Home Button is now no more clickable , it is gives you a haptic feedback . 8. 7MP Front Camera, Dust,water,Splash Resistant, Stereo Speakers with Better Quality Audio output. Here are Some cons of this Phone . 1. Only Single Lighting Port for work you do with iphone Like Charging,Data Transfer, Listing Music . So You can Do only one work at a time . 2. Price is too High! 3. ....................................... (Space is blank if you find Anything Comment ) ============== Verdict ============== So does it make a mostly Android user like me want to switch to the new Apple iPhone 7 Plus? In all likelihood, yes if you can get past the price of Rs 72,000 for the 32 GB variant. And agreed, what the new Apple iPhone 7 Plus has are features, which people have already seen on other devices. So, what sets it apart? In true Apple style the makers have taken these already seen features and made them even better. Good enough to make iPhone worth a buy, even for an Android stalwart. vote me if you found my review helpful :) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tip for Buying :- 1. If you have iphone 7 and 6S than Don't Buy this .. 2. Check for the Offer on Amazon with Banks they will gives 10-15% Discount,"
