134236,mobile,"I bought the phone on Amazon and been using my Samsung M30s for couple of weeks now. Delivery experience from Amazon - top notch. The best thing about the phone is its battery life. With normal usage, the battery works for days. With lots of gaming and app usage, it still easily works for 2 days. With 6000 mAH battery life is no problem at all. The 6.4"" super AMOLED display is awesome. The camera notch at top is minimum. Gives a very immersive experience while gaming or watching videos. With 8 core CPU, performance of gaming and other heavy apps is extremely good. The back camera is 48MP triple rear camera. What that means is you can snap photos normally and ultra-wide shots. The night mode is also good. Front camera is also good. No auto-focus for front camera. Optical image stabilisation is missing for both cameras. All in all, the camera is great in the price range. The pricing of the phone makes it a great buy. The build quality is similar to other Samsung phones. Very light weight and sleek phone. Only disadvantage I found is the speakers of this phone. No stereo support and the only speaker at the bottom is very low in volume. Verdict - With the given price range, the battery life, great camera and amazing display makes this phone a great buy !!"

157661,smartTv,"The iPhone 7 is legitimately among the most interesting, opinionated, powerful phones Apple has ever shipped, and the most confident expressions of the company's vision in a long time. New iOS 11 is excellent, the camera is much better, and the performance is phenomenal (stay away from Android users who say I have 4 - 6 - 8 - or - 100 GB of RAM, iPhone beats everyone in limited resources). Good Stuff - Water resistance - Improved cameras - Better battery life - Great display - Taptic engine feedback is neat Bad Stuff * Trust me these are advanced features that we are not used to if you are then these are Good stuff. - Lack of headphone jack is inconvenient - Wireless audio ecosystem is immature"

169807,mobile,"redmi 6A, budget smartphone, it is featured with decent camera and screen size, sound quality is good but speakers are at back side which sometimes interrupt your enjoyment while listening music without earphones, battery charges fast but drains also fast, may be it is due to its mediatek procerssor. overall for a light mobile user, it is a best option."
156689,mobile,Thanks
143806,mobile,Nice

153098,mobile,Realme U1 is really an awesome product.This is a mid range phone in terms of performance.Lets have a look at its pros and cons Pros:- 1.Vivid display and water droplet notch. 2.Best screen to body ratio 3.MediaTek Helio P70 SoC performs lag free performance 4.The front 25-megapixel camera captures detailed selfies and rear camera is decent too. 5.Fludic face detection 6.Good audio quality 7.Value for money Cons:- 1.Color OS not so intutive and takes time getting used to even for experienced smartphone users 2.Battery performance 3500 mha though decent but 5000 mha has become segment norm. 3.Average low light camera performance 4.No 4k video recording and video stabilisation 5.Body and screen is fingerprint and smudge magnet Realme U1 is a really value for money product and I credit Amazon for providing me a nice deal on my purchase.I got 3270 for my nearly 18 months old Moto G5 plus and Amazon gave me additional discount of nearly 1600 inr on Amazons special sales day.I got 5156 INR as final cart value.Nearl 10 days have passed and I am satisfied with the overall performance of the phone considering the budget.

118439,smartTv,"Bought this at a great price during the prime day sale. Had the previous gen full hd fire stick which served me well on my previous smart TV. Bought this to check out the improvements and also to compare it with the native apps on WebOS on my TV. This literally blows away the native apps. Dolby vision, hdr10 works flawlessly. I had my doubts about the wifi since I'm pretty old school and always hardwire stuff. But the AC wifi on this works even better than the wired ethernet connection on my TV. The apps run great and super fast. Lastly and this is my opinion a huge huge win.. Plex. This stick actually plays 4K in plex without transcoding with absolutely no issues. That just sealed the deal for me. Granted you need a pretty beefy pc to do this and mine is, but even then the WebOS plex app used to glitch out every now and then. Tip : Keep the hdr on the stick to adaptive and tweak the dolby vision and hdr settings on your TV separately. Once you nail them right, there's no going back to native apps. Super Duper Impressed!!"
145281,mobile,Nice performance but battery life is very poor

169158,mobile,nice
134346,mobile,"I bought this phone because of it's battery life , but display and performance of the phone is also very good with 4gb ram. Little disappointed with built quality. Cheap plastic used fit and finishs are fine. Upper body vibrates while using primary speaker at full volume because of plastic body. Display may broke if mobile falls from hand in normal conditions because of battery size and its weight. I would suggest to buy hard case for better safety instead of flexible silicone cases. At this price its good deal."

112590,mobile accessories,"Amazing super Amoled display and jumbo battery backup are the key attraction of M30s. Various features like recycle bin , anazing camera quality, etc are also but also lacks the three finger screenshot feature and screen recording which are very handy.

157849,smartTv,"The on board OS could have been better. Better tuned hardware could have avoided the long boot up time. Other than that, a good buy. Tripping on 60fps 4k's like no tomorrow. P.s. Should have had the option to install more streaming apps. Certain apps have been blocked from the play store. Eg. Prime."
158086,mobile accessories,The phone is great for the price. More so because of the additional discounts received during the sale.
138409,smartTv,"It is a OK product though works slow after 2 month, all features of remote don't work."
114651,smartTv,Awesome product. But needs to be plugged in to charge all time. I thought it will be usable without the plug in as well. Otherwise good product

136984,books,"I used to watch Sadhguru videos on youtube. The similar kind of portion is covered in the book, but in brief way. It is like manual which can help you to understand yourself better and better. It is a masterpiece one can say, but this book has confused me a lot. The book has lots of things one can implement, but it is not easy to change someone's perspective to see the life. Its useless if you just read some book for your knowledge and do nothing about it."

137184,mobile,"I wasn't really into ""Mi"" brand but after using this product I have changed my mind and this one's really good. I charge my Nokia 7 Plus (3800 mAh) and still I can see 50-75% battery left and build of product is incredible, it feels so solid in hand and easy to carry. As well I charged my iPad pro 2017 fully using it. The fast charge output is so good it charges nearly same as the dash/ fast/turbo chargers that come with the phone. Overall thumbs up"

166062,mobile accessories,Worst experience and bad product. Even for 1st boot its not loading and in boot loop for hours. With 3-4 attempts of force restart its still stuck. Samsung have it in DNA to be bad production quality and over the top it was sent in a normal Amazon polybag packaging in place of bubble protective package and wonderfully kept under pile of 50-60 items in the rug bag of the delivery person.
127764,mobile,Good battery life. Weight is very light. Camera could have been better.
152247,smartTv,"Product was delivered in time. Excellent case provided by JBL in terms of packaging itself. Although expensive, the product quality and sound is too good. The sound doesnâ€™t faulter at high volume. Bluetooth connectivity is very good too. The depth of the sound and bass is awesome compared to other similar products of various brands. Surround sound effect is also great!! Havenâ€™t tasted the water resistant ability. Battery life is sincerely good. Mic for the phone isnâ€™t good. This review is for this product which is almost a couple months old with me."
142539,mobile accessories,Main Problem is when we make a call there is a icon in which there is a options for hold and mute button very close to ear piece so many times Hold option started automatically while talking with someone....
