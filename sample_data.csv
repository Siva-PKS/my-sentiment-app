134236,mobile,"I bought the phone on Amazon and been using my Samsung M30s for couple of weeks now. Delivery experience from Amazon - top notch. The best thing about the phone is its battery life. With normal usage, the battery works for days. With lots of gaming and app usage, it still easily works for 2 days. With 6000 mAH battery life is no problem at all. The 6.4"" super AMOLED display is awesome. The camera notch at top is minimum. Gives a very immersive experience while gaming or watching videos. With 8 core CPU, performance of gaming and other heavy apps is extremely good. The back camera is 48MP triple rear camera. What that means is you can snap photos normally and ultra-wide shots. The night mode is also good. Front camera is also good. No auto-focus for front camera. Optical image stabilisation is missing for both cameras. All in all, the camera is great in the price range. The pricing of the phone makes it a great buy. The build quality is similar to other Samsung phones. Very light weight and sleek phone. Only disadvantage I found is the speakers of this phone. No stereo support and the only speaker at the bottom is very low in volume. Verdict - With the given price range, the battery life, great camera and amazing display makes this phone a great buy !!"

157661,smartTv,"The iPhone 7 is legitimately among the most interesting, opinionated, powerful phones Apple has ever shipped, and the most confident expressions of the company's vision in a long time. New iOS 11 is excellent, the camera is much better, and the performance is phenomenal (stay away from Android users who say I have 4 - 6 - 8 - or - 100 GB of RAM, iPhone beats everyone in limited resources). Good Stuff - Water resistance - Improved cameras - Better battery life - Great display - Taptic engine feedback is neat Bad Stuff * Trust me these are advanced features that we are not used to if you are then these are Good stuff. - Lack of headphone jack is inconvenient - Wireless audio ecosystem is immature"

169807,mobile,"redmi 6A, budget smartphone, it is featured with decent camera and screen size, sound quality is good but speakers are at back side which sometimes interrupt your enjoyment while listening music without earphones, battery charges fast but drains also fast, may be it is due to its mediatek procerssor. overall for a light mobile user, it is a best option."
156689,mobile,Thanks

153098,mobile,Realme U1 is really an awesome product.This is a mid range phone in terms of performance.Lets have a look at its pros and cons Pros:- 1.Vivid display and water droplet notch. 2.Best screen to body ratio 3.MediaTek Helio P70 SoC performs lag free performance 4.The front 25-megapixel camera captures detailed selfies and rear camera is decent too. 5.Fludic face detection 6.Good audio quality 7.Value for money Cons:- 1.Color OS not so intutive and takes time getting used to even for experienced smartphone users 2.Battery performance 3500 mha though decent but 5000 mha has become segment norm. 3.Average low light camera performance 4.No 4k video recording and video stabilisation 5.Body and screen is fingerprint and smudge magnet Realme U1 is a really value for money product and I credit Amazon for providing me a nice deal on my purchase.I got 3270 for my nearly 18 months old Moto G5 plus and Amazon gave me additional discount of nearly 1600 inr on Amazons special sales day.I got 5156 INR as final cart value.Nearl 10 days have passed and I am satisfied with the overall performance of the phone considering the budget.

118439,smartTv,"Bought this at a great price during the prime day sale. Had the previous gen full hd fire stick which served me well on my previous smart TV. Bought this to check out the improvements and also to compare it with the native apps on WebOS on my TV. This literally blows away the native apps. Dolby vision, hdr10 works flawlessly. I had my doubts about the wifi since I'm pretty old school and always hardwire stuff. But the AC wifi on this works even better than the wired ethernet connection on my TV. The apps run great and super fast. Lastly and this is my opinion a huge huge win.. Plex. This stick actually plays 4K in plex without transcoding with absolutely no issues. That just sealed the deal for me. Granted you need a pretty beefy pc to do this and mine is, but even then the WebOS plex app used to glitch out every now and then. Tip : Keep the hdr on the stick to adaptive and tweak the dolby vision and hdr settings on your TV separately. Once you nail them right, there's no going back to native apps. Super Duper Impressed!!"
145281,mobile,Nice performance but battery life is very poor

169158,mobile,nice
134346,mobile,"I bought this phone because of it's battery life , but display and performance of the phone is also very good with 4gb ram. Little disappointed with built quality. Cheap plastic used fit and finishs are fine. Upper body vibrates while using primary speaker at full volume because of plastic body. Display may broke if mobile falls from hand in normal conditions because of battery size and its weight. I would suggest to buy hard case for better safety instead of flexible silicone cases. At this price its good deal."

157849,smartTv,"The on board OS could have been better. Better tuned hardware could have avoided the long boot up time. Other than that, a good buy. Tripping on 60fps 4k's like no tomorrow. P.s. Should have had the option to install more streaming apps. Certain apps have been blocked from the play store. Eg. Prime."
158086,mobile accessories,The phone is great for the price. More so because of the additional discounts received during the sale.
138409,smartTv,"It is a OK product though works slow after 2 month, all features of remote don't work."

136984,books,"I used to watch Sadhguru videos on youtube. The similar kind of portion is covered in the book, but in brief way. It is like manual which can help you to understand yourself better and better. It is a masterpiece one can say, but this book has confused me a lot. The book has lots of things one can implement, but it is not easy to change someone's perspective to see the life. Its useless if you just read some book for your knowledge and do nothing about it."

I charge my Nokia 7 Plus (3800 mAh) and still I can see 50-75% battery left and build of product is incredible, it feels so solid in hand and easy to carry. As well I charged my iPad pro 2017 fully using it. The fast charge output is so good it charges nearly same as the dash/ fast/turbo chargers that come with the phone. Overall thumbs up"

166062,mobile accessories,Worst experience and bad product. Even for 1st boot its not loading and in boot loop for hours. With 3-4 attempts of force restart its still stuck. Samsung have it in DNA to be bad production quality and over the top it was sent in a normal Amazon polybag packaging in place of bubble protective package and wonderfully kept under pile of 50-60 items in the rug bag of the delivery person.
127764,mobile,Good battery life. Weight is very light. Camera could have been better.
152247,smartTv,"Product was delivered in time. Excellent case provided by JBL in terms of packaging itself. Although expensive, the product quality and sound is too good. The sound doesnâ€™t faulter at high volume. Bluetooth connectivity is very good too. The depth of the sound and bass is awesome compared to other similar products of various brands. Surround sound effect is also great!! Havenâ€™t tasted the water resistant ability. Battery life is sincerely good. Mic for the phone isnâ€™t good. This review is for this product which is almost a couple months old with me."
142539,mobile accessories,Main Problem is when we make a call there is a icon in which there is a options for hold and mute button very close to ear piece so many times Hold option started automatically while talking with someone....

159848,mobile,"This is not a phone , it's a beast . Samsung calling it as monster, yes it's a monster -display quality is next to none in this price range ( none of the phones can come close to this ) , - Call quality ,signal reception is just great . - Earpiece is so loud and even at high volume you'll not find any distortion . -Battery life is stellar ( real monster) - Though it has 6k mah battery the weight distribution is great , it doesn't feel bulky . - One UI is so smooth it has plenty of features you can play around, you'll easily get used to the UI ( it's very simple & feature rich ) . - Camera under good lighting situations produces great pics , Dynamic range is good , colour saturation is great . -Low light/ artificial light camera is average. ( C+) - selfie camera under good lighting situations produces decent photos , struggle at low light. -Video stabilization is A+ just awesome - auto focus in video is a hit or miss - you can even play PUBG at high graphics with minimal frame drops , gaming also good If you want A+ display A+ battery life and low light camera is on your low priority then this is the phone for you. I'm in love with the phone ( low light camera is not the highest priority for me ) Watch the 1hour full review in YouTube Adithya Vlogs"

153693,mobile accessories,"Samsung M30s is a very good phone, Pros:- 1) Big battery 2) Sleek and premium design 3) Super Amoled display Cons:- 1) No Notification light. 2) Camera quality can be improved little bit. 3) Should give atleast 20-25W fast charging as battery is 6000mah despite it has 15w fast charging still it takes approx 2 hours 40 minutes from 0 to 100%. REST everything is nice will recommend can go for it for sure. Samsung design and one ui is also nice."
163635,smartTv,"Very good quality for 4K, UHD. Its looking Nice"
123238,mobile,Exlent
159563,mobile accessories,"This is a premium phone in this range as its build quality is excellent. The interface is so much easier and handy. The battery is also very impressive as It can last upto a day and a half . The fingerprint scanner and the face detection is also quite impressive in this segment, the response time is less than a second. There is no lag while playing games ,the screen quality is very good. The light sensor is very responsive also the camera quality is nice and given that the wide camera lens makes it much more interesting. Talking about the front camera it is also impressive as compared to the price tag of the phone . It also has fast charging and charges it at a rate of 1 to 2 percent per minute or slight less than a minute. The body is scratch less and the it comes with a single speaker but it is more than enough. The touch is very smooth and feathery. There are many additional features like increase touch sensitivity while using gloves and device manager. And nonetheless it comes with a brand value of Samsung providing nice service all around the globe and easy to locate the service centers anywhere in India or in any other country. So my recommendation is to go for it because in this range the Samsung has offered everything to make it a premium flagship ."
158153,mobile,"The phone is sleek and looks sexy! However the battery life is bad..... using apps and the phone continuously for sometime drains out the battery really quick, which is a huge draw back for a new phone! Secondly iOS 13 is taking up quite a lot of space therefore 32GB IPhone is just not recommended! Camera is just good! Overall not satisfied with 6S 32GB"

165580,mobile,"With it's 6000 mah battery m30s is an awesome purchase, in hand experience is really good and feels lightweight compared to the massive battery it has. Camera quality is really good and looks natural, ultra wide is love ðŸ˜ Gaming experience on M30s is amazing and smooth, we can play heavy games easily without any lag. Game Booster is very helpful while gaming as we can block all the notifications and popups. M30s comes with every feature a person needs on his device(big battery, good performance, great camera, awesome design) with such attractive price. #GoMonster"

Once purchase there is no refund if you don't like the product 2. The camera is pathetic. A bellow 10k phone is far better than 48mp triple camera pictures. In low lights not a single picture you will like to keep after taking snaps. 3. The speaker sound is not even clearly audio able in home itself, very low sound . You have to make pindrop sound silence to hear the sound. The micro phone does not picks up sound with a little distance. Please don't become a pray of marketing skills of Amazon for selling samsung mobiles."

159953,mobile,This is the best mobile provided by realme at this price range. The design and look of the phone is very good. The phone works excellent and battery life is superb. The charging speed of the phone is also good. The rear camera of the phone is also fine but the portrait mode of the phone is not that ok. It sometimes blur the edge of the object and the sharpness of the picture is not that great in the portrait mode. Although front camera is very good and takes very good selfies. At last the phone is very good choice at this price range and it is value for the money product.
139823,smartTv,It's is a masterpiece! The camera is just amazing and the improved display and water resistance makes the phone very sprcial. Would definitely recommend it if you can afford it. The better companion to this phone in a lower price segment is oneplus 3t

157871,mobile,The only reason behind purchasing this was the step counting. And to my utter disappointment it's pedometer is faulty. It counts the hand/wrist movement as steps. I am really sad that even after spending so much it did not serve my purpose. Please don't waste your money. Pacer app on mobile is far more accurate than this wasteful gadget.
159519,mobile,This is a good product. I like the mic quality very much. I can talk using this in a crowded place still the other person hear in a good quality voice.

And I was not disappointed. Though I don't have any fascination on Mobile camera, Still like to say that it is awesome. I feel no one can beat Samsung on this part, except iPhone. Battery lasts for almost 1 and half day with my wifi on most of the times. Screen resolution is also awesome. In single word this is a excellent phone at this price. thank you Samsung."

I love the apps available on the app store and the watch faces are all awesome !!! I love that i can store music on it...i dont need to carry my phone for music while running anymore... Its GPS is almost perfect at par with Garmin !!! Its Heart rate monitor is good but not perfect... The swivelling bezel is what i love the most....it feels awesome to use the watch...

134050,mobile,I am writing this review after using it for more than one week. At this price point this phone is amazing. I should say battery is really a monster. Let me explain individual points : Display : It's super amoled. So no doubt display is 5/5. Camera : we have triple camera setup here. 48 mp gives good detail and wide angle lens also gives a good coverage. Performance of depth camera is also good. Front camera is performing good when u have good lighting. In low lighting if you are taking individual selfies then you have option of display flash and that gives a good. Performance : this mobile is performing really good in day to day usage. UI : less customization available. But easy to use that is good. Battery : that is a real MONSTER. I love small mobiles so it could have been a complete killer for me if screen size is less than 6 inches.

153528,mobile accessories,"Right decision taken by Samsung to reduce the price by 1000â‚¹ within 15 days of its launched. Those who (including me) have purchased it with its original price feels cheated. But I still believe with its current price 7999 the phone is not worth as you can get much better options. So I will not be surprised if it makes another price cut within next 15 days. Now abt the phone , I only find the battery and the super amoled screen good, Rest the camera , cpu performance and signal strength not good. Finger print sensor is slow. For comparison the Redmi 7 gives better performance than this phone. I am sure with this price bracket there are much better options available in amazon itself."

I think I don't need to review an iPhone! It is out of the world, no doubt about that, but I am here surprised because I actually got an email, asking me to give 1 star rating to iPhone7 on amazon.in, and in return, they'll send me some freebies! This is both terrible and concerning. Looking at the reviews now, it is quite evident that people in India are obviously believing this. EVERY 1/2/3 star review is fake, and it is really easy to spot one. - NONE of them have 'Verified Purchase' badge, infact as of now, I am the only one with this badge! - Most accounts were created on the same date to get the freebies. - Most have only 1 item review history. I hope they all are getting their free USB data cable. - There are bots that can create these fake amazon accounts with disposable email ID's. I have reported this issue to amazon, and I hope they are taking required actions."

139926,mobile accessories,It's not at all worth the money and the main reason is its wireless connectivity. Sounds keeps on distorting when you are in motion and your phone is in your pocket or at some distance and that's the main reason for using wireless headphones which this does not fulfils
129176,mobile,Good phone brought it during Diwali sales!

My realme2 had around 3200mah battery, but that used to last longer than m30's 5000mah battery. Finger print is slow at times. Camera is good.

Don't buy iPhone unless you are living in United States since iPhone customer service their after sales suck in India. I purchased this XR for the initial price of 76600, I went on a trip and some water spilled the phone stopped working, the screen went blank. I took it to the service center and they say by looking at the screw of the phone that someone already tried to open the screw and it won't be covered under warranty and they were not even willing to open the phone and check...so my 70k product is lying at home with me still paying my emi's. It was the greatest mistake I have done and I have learnt my lesson and I don't want people to suffer like me. I have not much complaints on the product quality. But what is more important is that after sales service of the product. So I urge everyone not to waste money on this product. You get phones with better features than iPhone and at cheaper price. Be smart."

For my un-fortunate belief, every website shown phone which were costing not less than 10k. Redmi 6A, RedMI Rocks again !!! Once again, one of the best product from Redmi for optimal price with excellent features. Pros: Support 2 JIO sims at once. Dual sim jio lovers certainly cant miss this phone. Slim, light weight and enough handy. Performance and Speed wise, its a good call Camera, Sound and Seemless transition is good Security options plenty. Voice quality is good Cons : Average battery. No finger print. Overall, It served my need of 2 JIO sims for which, I am so happy about this product. Thank you Redmi... Keep rocking !!!"

133218,mobile accessories,Hi Sharing review after having tough times with this phone. I bought this product though within a week experienced heating problem and suddenly phine gets off. I had asked amazon care for an exchange and after having a strong discussuion of nearly 1 hour convinced to replace this product on its last day of exachange. After having an exchange product color was not the same what i had ordered in my first order still thought not to have another argument for it. The replaced product is working fine without having heating problem or anything though not heavy used like gaming.. this leads me might earlier one was a faulty product. I would not highly recommend this even my whole family is having samsung :) you can go for A50 which would be the better one than this Overall phone is decent to use only if you're not installing heavy applications or games.
114069,smartTv,Awesome experience I'm very happy with my purchase everything is good
156919,mobile,The Phone was damaged. Small scratches on the sides. Never expected this would happen with the brand new phone.
134027,mobile accessories,I am writing this review after 2 months of Use. Pros- AMOLED screen Fast Charging Very Good Battery Optimization Cons- Some times finger print sensor works 5 out of 10 times. Can't play heavy games

Display & screen resolution is pretty good ,really loved it. Performance is good and very soothing. Battery doesn't run out easily & easy to charge, it charges upto 25 percent within 30 minutes & takes 2 Â½ hours for full charge. Con's:- Back panel looks kinda good but as it is plastic it is easy to get damaged & not at all scratch resistant . They didn't provided back case & headset. Its durability is poor . OVERALL THE BEST PHONE AT THIS PRICE RANGE..."

170080,mobile,the phone doesn't live upto its expectations as per the specs. processor speed is very disappointing. camera is pretty average. below average phone...
154804,smartTv,Sound bass is really good but USB music should be upgraded where it will be more convenient than playing Bluetooth through mobile phone.
150514,mobile,Phone is good but battery draining too fast Heating issue is major drawback. But after 15 days of use I think it is the best phone in this range. Heating issues are almost in control.

Build quality is good. 2. Sound is good. 3. Battery backup is nice too. 4. Full HD at 30,000 bucks is good. 5. Windows 10 original 6. Good for multimedia purpose usage. CONS : 1. Due to factory installed Windows 10, it is slow after booting. Disk usage is high. So for programming purpose, you either format and install Windows 7 / 8.1 or upgrade your RAM to 8 GB."

Pros: =>Good sound quality,a very good bass, =>good battery backup(really it plays upto 45mins with10mins charging) =>Fits perfectly to my ears(various sizes of extra buds added) =>light weight cons: No cons for sound quality,but i feel that Wires are bit lengthy(but i compromised for bass and sound quality) Finally kudukara kaasuku worthu!!"

134083,mobile,"I bought 128g at 57k performing much faster and more smoother experience on an iPhone. Battery life is above average. app switching is lightning fast. Portrait mode is working fine with perfect edge detection. PUBG freaks you can play in fully max video setting without any lag at all. Though the packaging was terrible only one plastic wrap was there, expected to be inside a box ."
165984,refrigerator,"Worst Fitbit band!! It counts steps when I am asleep. When you are on bike, steps are counted again. Move your hands, it counts. For the same range you will get gear S3 which is much more efficient if you can live with it by charging every 2 days. I have requested for replacement and the replacement device is in customs for last 2 weeks and Fitbit doesnt do anything about this. Your country your headache!!! Buy Mi band or honor bands which got service centers which are also offered at lesser pricing"

154099,mobile,Serious network issue. Don't think of purchasing it if your area have moderate signal quality as shown on other phones. The phone is having problem in video call using the default dialler app. Coins Network reception power too low to work. Camera have actually 12 megapixel sensor. I have tested it with multiple app downloaded from play store. Pro Good battery backup. The Samsung UI don't have ads. The 12 megapixel camera show good performance in low light condition. Purchase the phone only if your area has very very good network coverage. Otherwise you have to use the phone over Wi-Fi only.

Samsung being a big player, don't know why they play such cheap tricks by saying camera is 48MP on paper and fooling people by providing a low quality camera in actual. This phone should have been priced under 10K. Not worth of 14K."

160063,smartTv,"This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc. Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo. For example when you say- 1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer. 2) continue with next query like how to reach there ? Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do.. This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there. Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you. Amazon music has very limited music base. So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans."

142961,mobile,Mobile is good and other feature is fine but we are facing heat issue and asked for amazon team for replacement. Worst service like amazon i never faced with any of the online companies. I don't know what is the policy of amazon for replacement plan. We brought this mobile just week before and logged complain with amazon in 2nd day for heating issue while call. Amazon spoiling the name of reputed companies.

153877,smartTv,"Satisfied with the product! Screen display is absolutely brilliant, better than any other phone currently in the market along with stereo speakers that give an excellent experience if you tend to watch videos or listen to songs using the speakers. Since I upgraded from an iPhone 6, I found the speed to be slightly but noticeably faster. Battery backup is the normal duration what you'd expect from an iPhone about a day with the wifi or 4G switched on. Only problem I found was a bit of a heating problem which only happened a few times."

By mistake, my keys got in touch with the display of the phone, but there was not a single scratch. Even i use my phone so roughly on daily basis like a rough user of cellphone but the screen is still fine and did not got any any scratches over it. The time i have bought M-20 that was the time i have fallen for with my phone. Samsung is doing so great work for millennials."

136728,mobile accessories,"I received the phone about two weeks back and immediately noticed that it gives out a mild electric shock while charging the phone. Not only that but even with very light use, the phone overheats. Looks like Apple chose to lower their standards to keep their high margins while selling for Indian customers and hence the lower price. I might have received a lemon but I highly doubt it."

Fingerprint reader is not upto the notch,it sometimes didn't just let you in and you have to enter password. All is good but the problem is that this started to cause issues in just 1.5 years,,it automatically just switch off without any issue which is quite frustrating.IDK why android phones are not long lasting. All comes with the age limit cap of 2 years i guess so you have to buy again."

160265,mobile,This phone has some serious network issues. The same SIM when put into some other phone shows 80 to 100% network but in this phone it shows 50 to 60%. Call drops and voice stuck ups over a call are quite frequent. Rest all features are top notch but it is very unlike samsung to undermine such a basic phone feature. I've not used any cover and tried every setting I could but still this issue exists. I hope samsung fixes this through some software patch.
130850,books,Good read
116326,mobile,"Been using this device for last 4 days & made following observations: * Battery is a beast. U will never run out of charge wid dis device. * Screen is treat to look at. Watching videos is first class experience. * No heating or lag observed in what ever little gaming I did. * Build quality is nice. * Gud ram mgmt. * Android 1 is buttery smooth. Minimal app overhead which can b easily uninstalled. * Charging is not superfast but wid given bettery size I would say it's pretty fast. * Fingerprint & face unlock both working gr8. * Call quality & signal reception both good. Also wifi connection working properly. D only con I observed in dis brief tenure is der is no way to put data rate displaying at the status bar. All & all a gud buy at dis price point. If u are not a gamer & want a reliable handset for everyday use, I'll definitely recommend dis phone to you."

158571,mobile accessories,The product is working quite good. Impressed with the rear camera but an 8MP front camera needs to do a better job than what it is doing.

119649,mobile accessories,"Candid Feedback to all the Amazon Viewers out there: STPL Seller seems to be a big FRAUD I have received a REFURBISHED product which has following issues simply at the start of the device with NO SIM - Phone takes about 60-80 seconds as recorded by Stopwatch to open any app - Heating way higher simply in a 10 mins call - With hardly any usage within 8 hours phone drains from 100%to 30%battery - At last as a Prime customer Faced Horrible CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE from a fake Supervisor called Saiqal who changed his name as Rakesh as next level and finally hung up on me. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED to see that for our HARD EARNED MONEY INVESTMENT,EVEN A REPLACEMENT FROM AMAZON IS A HIGHLY STRUGGLING JOB.

111561,smartTv,"Alexa is very bad in searching things. It every time says ""Sorry I don't know"" bleakly. She even cannot tell about the search engine she uses. For your information, she using Bing. Yucks! There is only buzz for alexa while google home is far far superior than it. Very bad experience. I'm not at all amused by this. Rest of the things are at par with google home but google home wins in the end. And alexa ""Sorry I don't know"" but you're a garbage"

132730,smartTv,"HI, I am writing this review after using it for a month for doing development on Visual Studio. The laptop performance is pathetic. I decided to do a RAM upgrade. I thought while buying, looking at Amazon's product specs (pls see the picture) which said there are two RAM slots and hence I can do an upgrade to 12 GB. But when I spoke to HP Technical support, they were not sure. They asked me to check if it has two RAM slots. The Gadgets now page states that it has only one RAM slot. (please see the picture). So buyers, pls check with Amazon or HP before buying. I will come to know the status after I take it to HP's authorised service agent. Updates on 18th Sep. Hi, I would like to update for the benefit of those who had read my earlier review. I managed to speak to HP and got a confirmation that the laptop does have two RAM slots. I have bought an additional 8 GB RAM card and have installed the same on this laptop and the laptop is working fine. So now I have two RAM slots - one with a 4 GB Ram card and another with 8 GB Ram card. The laptop shows 12 GB RAM and I am seeing a marked improvement in performance."
124299,smartTv,"Flip 4 is decent sound with base, works well for my requirement, sound is clear crisp and looks very classy, but it is not very loud, any one want high volumes can go for JBL charge 3, sound quality is very good, battery looks Okay, i tried playing it continuous for 5hrs. Worth for this price . JBL has gain trust of millions. Not tried any test for waterproof. Once again its not very loud but it is very very clear and crisp with okay bass."

141522,mobile,Let's come direct to the point....... Pro's 1. A big massive battery lasts easily 2 days 2. Super amoled screen 3. Performance Cons 1. Plastic build 2. Doesn't have a gorilla glass 3. Some times for a minute or two the phone gets slightly heated on the upper part when you download any file . I think these 3 pro's and cons will help you ....just go and grab in price segment 13k

110040,smartTv,"#This is a review after fairly one week of use This Laptop is really very good. It has one of the best features that an ideal budget gaming laptop should have. It has a 1TB SSHD(You can consider it to be a storage system which lies between a normal HDD and an SSD), which is really very fast, alongwith a 128GB SSD, which makes the system even more faster. This is the reason why it takes not more than 15 seconds to boot up! This is really incredible! It is powered by Intel core i5 - 8300H, which is better than Intel Core i7 - 8550U! Talking about its Graphics Processor, It has an NVIDIA GTX 1050 with 4GB VRAM, which is ideal considering its price. I've played a couple of games, CS:GO and Apex Legends. Both the games have really eye-catching graphics. The laptop has no problem at all in running both the games. The FPS count in both the games were within 50 - 60(for CS:GO) and 40 - 70(for Apex Legends) which is mind - blowing at this price! (FPS drops when the charger is not plugged in). Talking about its cooling, it just takes the prize over that, as its cooling is one of the best, not between the budget segment, but also between the expensive or flagship gaming laptops. The track-pad is big enough for daily use(The gestures are very useful). The keyboard is also amazing! The flow and the responsiveness or feedback given by the keyboard is just wonderful. With the red - backlit keyboard(With 3 levels of brightness), the keyboard looks fabulous. The screen is also very good. It is a FHD IPS - level display, with crunchy colours. All the necessary ports are available on the laptop except Type - C port, which is a negative point I found on the laptop. Also there is one con, the screen is fairly big, it is 15. 6 inch, but the bezels around the screen are big. This is a point of personal preference where some might like bezel - less screens, whereas some may like screens with big bezels. The webcam fitted in the laptop is very bad, as expected, which should not be a problem for most of the people. One thing which I liked about the laptop is that the stereo speakers present in the laptop is very loud, which is surprisingly very good, as this is the problem of most of the laptops, where the speakers remain the weak - point of many expensive laptops, being a powerhouse. But this is not the case with this laptop. The speakers are really good in this laptop. Lastly, my final verdict is - YES! THIS IS DEFINITELY A LAPTOP WORTH BUYING. This is really a very good deal at this price point."
115151,mobile,Bad product after 6 month product was death

124550,smartTv,Front camera is awesome but batter discharge very fast
163610,smartTv,Very good project
140726,mobile,Its slim light weighted and amazing camera quality. Battery back up is excellent. Purchased at excellent deal price. Thanks amazon.
124209,mobile,"First off, the battery life is INCREDIBLE! This is the first phone I have used where I can get two days of use on one charge! I would regularly charge the phone overnight one night, then go to bed at midnight with 55-60% left the next night, leave it unplugged, and finish the next day at midnight with around 2-5%. The size of the phone was just just about perfect for holding/scrolling with one hand, and I usually wear menâ€™s size medium gloves for reference. The notch didn't bother me when using the phone for basic functions, but was annoying when watching videos; and I was a lot of videos on my phone, so that was kinda a deal breaker. Itâ€™s not that the notch bothered me by covering content, but rather the aspect ratio was based off the bottom of the notch instead of the top of the screen, so 18:9 aspect ratio videos either always had gaps around the notch, or they were cut off when zoomed to fit; 16:9 videos obviously didnâ€™t fill the screen nicely either and made for a viewing experience closely resembling that of the older small iPhones. I also didnâ€™t like the 18:9 aspect ratio in general as most videos I watch are still in the more common 16x9 aspect ratio. Face ID was very cool when logging into apps and websites that use password, but it wasnâ€™t very consistent when unlocking the phone in the mornings (when half my face was shoved into a pillow and I looked like hell), when the phone was oriented sideways, or when the phone was lying on the table; ultimately, I reverted to turning off the security entirely. At that point, the notch became even more of an annoyance, since I wasnâ€™t using Face ID; however, I did not use Touch ID on older iPhones either. With that being said, I do like Face ID better than Touch ID of previous iPhones. Another downside to the iPhone XR is the resolution. While the screen is indeed VERY nice to look at, the resolution was less that I would prefer. I would not have noticed the lower resolution of the screen if I had not been comparing it next to the iPhone 8 Plus. The problem is not with the screen itself, but that some apps had downsampled the display to 720p, instead of 1080p, which was very noticeable. I would say the iPhone XR screen is better looking than the iPhone 8 Plus in terms of producing deeper blacks and slightly better colors, and the lower resolution isnâ€™t noticeable except for some apps as previously mentioned. Overall, the iPhone XR is and awesome but, and I recommend it, but I ended up returning it for the iPhone 8 Plus simply for the wider screen with 16:9 aspect ratio, and higher resolution. Thanx to amazon for the speedy delivery and price"
140414,mobile accessories,"Its all fine but very slim, phone width is very less but yes it looks like iphone (Width Size and overall look). If someone likes a wider phone then I won't suggest/recommend it."

120232,mobile accessories,Dear Viewers I am written this review after usage f 15 days of this phone. Pros: Superb phone with monster battery life. Display is good. Cons: OTG is not supported in this phone. Camera is not like 48 megapixel. Charging cable is very short and back cover is also not provided in box. Back side of phone is simple and plastic not giving rich feel in this price segment. OS is ok Finger print sensor is ok not much faster as redmi. So the conclusion is not looking for battery life. Other things are also important.
115029,mobile accessories,Back camera is dislike processor is good

Not even 24 hrs, it is lasting it's even earlier,,,, Apart from battery all other features like operating system, storage, camera, heating everything is good..."
154497,smartTv,"So I have been using android since long and thought that this is the right time to switch to iOS So I bought iphone7 jet black back in November 2016 and it's still working great for me. PROS 1)Faster than the previous IPhones 2)Camera quality is really good. Over the last couple of years, I have clicked a lot of photos. 3)Home button feels good and you can customize it according to your own comfort 4)Battery Backup is decent enough. Cons 1) Jet black scratches easily 2) Can't charge when using the provided earphones even though I generally prefer my Bluetooth earphones. 3) Limited connectivity to smartwatches apart from apple watch. I use a Gear S3 and there are some features that you can't use with iOS."

Happy with my purchase!"
161555,smartTv,"Using iPhone 7 from last 9 months and my experience is amazing either in terms of user interface or camera or sound or the most important itâ€™s speed. Even 4 or 6 gb of android may not have processing as fast as iPhone. Battery life is also good but the only drawback is itâ€™s heating a little bit if I use it in temperature that go beyond the recommended range for its surrounding temperature. Rest everything is good. If you want to buy iPhone 7 in 2018, itâ€™s worth buying."

168447,books,gud
134154,smartTv,I bought it as an upgrade for iPhone 5S and it's been dismal purchase. In about 2 years time its battery has gone for a toss especially after moderate usage of internet (not more than 3:30 hours). 5S is still better than this. Apple might have reduced the price from 44k to 29k but it's still not worth it. Once a great fan of Apple I see now no point to use its phone as it seems to have intentionally slowed down the phone and done something to kill the battery.
140680,mobile accessories,Its okk okk Like fringe print is fyn but battery life is not that much good But fast changing so very good mobile in this range
125531,mobile,Good

153147,mobile,Rear camera should have beem better otherwise the phone is perfect in this price range

113167,mobile,"As soon as you receive ur phone, whether you on it or not, Enter Fastboot and Unlock its bootloader. I bricked my first phone after security update of January. I got a replacement. Mi still doesnâ€™t bother about its phones after multiple users reported same issue. Second phone arrived from West Bengal. Silicon case has no camera protection. First phone was from Bangalore. It had a protection for camera."
134391,mobile,"I bought this product 6 months ago. This product is working completely fine. The USB cable is not working but power bank performance is very outstanding. It can charge 3-4 times for an average android battery (3000mAh). Build quality is nice and light weight. To fully charge this power bank it takes about 6-7 hours with 2A charger. If you have more than 3500mAh android battery then I'll recommend to buy the 20,000mAh power bank as it will charge your phone more number of times than this 10,000mAh bank. I've been using it very properly and also bought cover for this power bank which makes it shock proof. I've provided the link below to buy cover for this. The provided link is for 20,000mAh bank cover but it perfectly fits for 10,000mAh battery also."
127704,mobile accessories,Good battery .but doesn't look like 5000 mah. Fast charging and good camera. Low light camera could have been better. Got first mobile replaced due to battery draining issue after long struggle with amazon customer care. Took almost 1 week for replacement very tiring.

121855,mobile,"Everything mentioned is upto the mark. But I personally feel camera quality and hardware quality of mobile back cover (white background) are not up to the mark. Performance, display, storage & battery are the best. Mobile is little heavy in terms of weight.. Overall, In terms of internal features (Ram, storage, battery) with low price go for M series. But In terms of features + premium hardware quality (lookwise) go for A series. I had a bad delivery experience this time with Amazon. Very late delivery."

Phone hang: after using for hours you'll see this phone getting hang. Charging: At first , you'll see fast charging but after some weeks, there's no such thing as fast charging. Infact I left the phone charging from 1:30 PM(27%) before exam but after I came from exam it was charged to only 61% at 3:20 pm (approximately but not less than 3:20 pm). So it took around 2 hours to charge to 34% and it's really disappointing for gamers like us.(Btw I'm writing this review just because of disappointment: the tempered glass and the back cover as well) . People don't really sell the product like they show from the Amazon pic."

132369,mobile,"Great product, a good upgrade from iPhone 6s, large screen, fast, water resistant, great camera, and looks good too"
139382,mobile accessories,It's a poor product with too much hype. Camera claims to be 48 MP but image quality does not match even 8 MP quality. Plastic back body which gives it a cheap product look more prominent in white color. My regret purchase. Do not fall in love with the specifications given. Regretting big time and moreover Amazon will not exchange the product. Many times these platform acts as a medium to distribute cheap product due to higher profit margins for them. Many phone such as Redmi Note 7 are much better phone at lower price

As, i have compared no one in competition is offering this. Lowlight with f1.9 and Live focus for Bokeh mode is handled very well. Both M20 & M10 offer the same rear dual camera Selfie Camera:The M20 has a front shooter of 8MP with Selfie focus and the results for the same very good. There is no over saturation and natural M10: Also comes with a great 5MP and f2.2 aperture with selfie the rear camera on both devices has Pro mode, stickers, auto focus, live focus, Panorama, beauty mode besides wide angle mode to capture 120 degree field of view compared to the front camera in both devices has live focus, stickers and selfie mode as well."

124338,mobile accessories,"For a Samsung device this is as good as it gets for the price this Phone is being offered at. Pros: Super Amoled Display with Full HD resolution, Humongous battery, Decent Processor, Above average camera, master the Pro mode for better shots, Widevine L1 suport Cons: Plastic built, feels cheap in hand, especially the finger print sensor feels hollow while tapping, Slow charging speeds, 15 watts is not very fast and much cheaper devices like note 7s and vivo u1 have 18 watt charging support, takes a good two and a half hour to charge No notification LED, Always on display slightly makes up for it, No ambient light sensor, uses front camera to adjust screen brightness which is slow. No Gorilla glass, tempered glass would be necessary All in all a great device for its price but with some compromises that aren't a deal breaker for most of the people."

Built quality excellent 10/10 Screen is ok ok 8/10 Sound quality is nice 9/10 But doesn't have headphone jack thats why audio quality decrease while using third party headphones. Charging time is very nice. Charge 0 to 100 within 1 hour. But discharging speed is also very nice. Battery drain very quickly. I charge this device 2 to 3 times a day. If i use normal like only 4G internet. No gaming, no movies then i have to charge it twice a day or if plag pubg then i have to charge 3 times a day for 2 hour pubg play."

147647,mobile,Not sooo good. Ok product. Still lagging issues are there and speaker is not good. Some noisy and echo coming from speaker and only one speaker. And android trapping the cookies and sending so many ads . even not able to see videos also. And sms too.worst mobile. Even amazon calling also not exchanging and not replacing. They are argueing with the customers. Stupid service from amazon and mi both of them for this mobile category. Wrongly brought it and no way to replace. Just cheating with the fake and low rated smartchk app for the device and this one will fake results. Even i have run the app in other devices which is not good. But this app says everything fine then amazon don't replace. Everyone finding their own ways to grab the money from the public.

136453,mobile,"I ordered this phone on Diwali offer. The phone which I got first had display issue , so I got replacement for that.my previous phone was iPhone 6 Plus. After one week of using this phone, these are my honest review. Firstly the phone has excellent battery life . For average use, the battery lasts more than a day easily. Although charging takes time ie about 2 to 3 hours from 10% to 100%. As I am used to iPhone home button, Iâ€™m feeling a bit uncomfortable with this phone as it has no home button. You have to swipe up every time from bottom to top to unlock the phone. It has no finger print sensor . So itâ€™s a bit difficult to unlock while ur in bed as u have to put ur face in front of the phone for FACE ID. Reach ability is an issue if u use one handed. Especially while using Facebook, when u have to swipe down from bottom line to make ur finger reach the top screen clicking options. Display of the screen is a bit below iPhone 6 Plus. So all in all the phone is just about satisfactory."

136888,smartTv,I think the product is just fine but the sound quality and touch pad are pathetic. It seems their is a problem of Touch pad in all LENOVO Laptops my old laptop was also lenove but different configuration it has the same problem touch pad quality and function is not good. I was expecting great sound quality but it turned out to be very poor. The battery back up is also not more than 3 hrs i was expecting it to be 5 atleast. Before zeroing on Lenovo I also checked acer laptop with almost the same configuration however fianalized lenovo due to its strong brand presence and sturdy products.

157841,mobile,The new samsung m30s is a pretty good mid range handset.The design looks very premium with a good color combination for the back.The 6.4 inch superamoled screen looks fantastic.The device comes with a notch display.The processor exynos 9611 is a new addition to the exynos fam and gives a balanced comb of power and performance. The device runs on android 9 with Samsung ui on the surface .The phone packs a triple rear camera setup with a 48mp primary and 8 mp wide angle plus 5mp depth cameras.Front camera is also a very good 16mp camera.The phone has a fingerprint scanner at the back and has face ai unlock feature as well.The picture quality of the camera is pretty decent comparing to the price of the smartphone. Low light photography is also well.Talking about the BIG 6000mah battery which gives 20 -24 hrs backup continuously is amazing. The charging time is also quite low as it has fast charging tech .Overall if your budget is somewhere around 15000 this phone is truly build for you .

124198,mobile,"First of all, kudos to Samsung for designing such an amazing phone at a cheap price. This phone is indeed an all rounder in all aspects. Let me sum up my review with the pros and cons... Pros: 1. Super Amoled screen: Amazing Display quality and viewing angles. Just loved the display provided by Samsung. Very immersive experience. If media consumption is your top priority then this phone will not depress you. 2. Monster 6000mah battery: Indeed this phone lasted me for more than 2 days with light usage scenarios. Overall great battery backup. Also there's 15W fast charger in the box so that's an added advantage in charging speed. 3. Performance: With exynos 9611 inside, the performance was pretty solid (like a monster). Multitasking and ram management was also a breeze. Playing high graphic games like pubg would be easily playable under high settings. 4. Camera: It houses a triple camera setup to the back. One 48MP shooter, one 8MP wide angle shooter and one 2MP depth sensor. The front camera is a 16MP shooter. Overall it shoots some great looking photos with good detail and sharpness. Now, however this phone excels in every aspect, there are still some minor cons present with the device which i want to share. 1. Camera: Although the camera quality is pretty great but still the quality of the image is not as expected. Specially the 48MP shooter shoots pictures which are not that detailed as compared with other competition. Also the front camera is little poor in capturing good lighting and detail of the subject under certain scenarios. However there's nothing much complain about the cameras and for this price it is still killer. Hence, my final verdict. If ur budget is strictly under 14k and you want great battery backup and performance then surely go for this phone, you will not be mistaken. However if your budget is little higher and camera is your main priority then I suggest you go for other competition which offer much better value for money. As for me, i am extremely in love with this phone. Thank you Samsung"

Pros : â€¢ Great Cameras - nightscape mode is good. â€¢ Amazing AMOLED Display â€¢ Faster Screen Unlock â€¢ Best Stereo Speakers â€¢ Lag free OS and UI â€¢ Call quality is good â€¢ No bloatwares â€¢ Fastest WARP charge Cons : â€¢ If you keep screen refresh rate at 90 Hz, battery lasts up to 12 hours with normal use. Nothing much cons to say. Overall it's a true flagship."

137689,smartTv,"If you're going to buy a new iPhone, this is the one to get â€“ there's a slightly longer battery life, a better camera, fast innards and protection against water. However, many of the changes are slight, and the iPhone 6S, for the lower price, suddenly becomes a very attractive option. FOR Good low light camera Water resistant Double the internal capacity AGAINST Lacks clear upgrades Same design used for last three phones Battery life unimpressive"
139463,mobile accessories,"It's almost perfect for me. However, note that its not ok if you intend to use it while jogging or running. While jogging it keeps cutting off, and gives lots of noise. This was not indicated in the specifications. Moreover, if you move 4/5 mtrs away from the phone, the sound will stop. This was not mentioned in the specifications."

154595,mobile,So i tried this phone for 3 days and i am in love with the features it offer at such a price my. Main highlight was the 6000 mah battery . It is superb and i charge my phone only once in 36 hours still working good . The charging is fast and the camera is also good for the price . I had my doubts after reading several reviews but i must say this is a worth buying phone so many awesome features and it runs smoothly.

110372,mobile,4 things are really important to me in a budget smartphone.. 1)good processor for gaming 2)big and good quality display 3) battery life 4) avg camera While buying this smartphone I was sure about all these things except the battery.... But now after using it for 3 months I will say that the battery life is very good considering that it has 3500mah battery on paper.. It will give you about 1day of battery with heavy usage (7 - 7:30 hours of SOT) and about 1.5 day on moderate usage (6 - 7 hours of SOT)

I have 6GB 128gb version, wanted to opt for realme XT but have chosen this for battery..... also got good discounts. Have not given 5stars as Samsung could have included a back cover with this but they wanted to save a few bucks here which is very disappointing."

Coming to battery life, I'm not gamer, i always sleep with 40% charge. So.... For my usage, juice will stay for 1Â½ day. Camera is beast. Everyone told in forums that, it's better to go for note 5 pro instead of A2. They are wrong, A2 is better than n5 pro. Except battery life, 5* for everything. 4000mah will be killer."

159005,mobile accessories,"There is little that I can say here about this beauty! The iPhone 6s is currently the best budget iPhone that you can get your hands on. It's been 4 days since I've been using this and I've only charged it twice. I use a good amount of internet for emails and research. The camera is just pure fun. It's feature packed and does the job better than most of the other counterparts out there. Switching from Andriod. I had my doubts. But the iOS is just a sheer pleasure to use. It's so simple yet incredibly effective! It's intuitive and makes your life really easy while working with the phone. For the price it is available right now, this is a must buy if you are considering buying a phone. Will post more updates when I've used it longer! And last but not the least... Thank you Amazon for the prompt delivery. Received the item one day before the estimated date! Simply brilliant!"
152871,smartTv,"Really a value for money product. I had to buy this after my age old CRT tv broke down beyond repairs. Got only 500 for it under exchange. The only problem I faced in first 3 months was the issue in connecting to home wifi, it used to take many minutes & multiple attempts to get it connected to wifi. But after a software update in January 2019, it started working well & now connects to home wifi quickly. The picture quality is quite good, looking at the price point of about 12k, bought it in Oct 2018. It connects & remains paired with my JBL Flip 3 bluetooth speaker easily. Streaming from my Samsung, Redmi & Lenovo mobiles is also easy over wifi. Voice recognition also works well. Very limited number of apps are enabled for android TV, however, you can also install additional apps using APK files from USB. Ok for browsing the Internet - had to download Puffin Browser. It takes sometime to get used to the quite hard remote buttons. Remote is very slim & sleek. As the remote is Bluetooth enabled, no need to point it directly to TV. I wish there was a direct setting to open/start the DTH/Cable input by default, as it is quite difficult to operate for elders in the family, as they don't know the remote navigation functions. I read someone complaining about not being able to install and run apps like Amazon Prime & Netflix on this TV. Please note that it is Amazon & Netflix's decision to not support this Android TV. Hence don't blame Xiaomi for this issue. It is due to the corporate fight between Google vs Amazon & Netflix. And has nothing to do with the capabilities of this TV."

Picture quality of you tube 4k and Full HD videos are great.All Full HD videos are great yo watch with so much details. I found it great buy. The only cons is that some of the connections are on the rear side and difficult to connect if once wall mounting is done.It would have been best if those would have been on the side.But considering all 4K smart TV features it is great Buy

134967,refrigerator,I got this product for my friend as a gift and it won't charge ..... Worst buy from Amazon till date....it's embarrassing to gift someone something that's damaged Would suggest don't buy it from Amazon and go for the Mi online store cause the deal directly from the manufacturer
139616,mobile,"It's been just less than a year I bought iPhone 6s model, and the device failed to switch on now. I surrendered the product for service under warranty. But they are saying, cannot provide warranty service because there is a small crack on the rear camera lens cover but the camera was functioning well and that happened so many months back. Now, I feel like durability and service of this product is verse than any other mobiles on the market."
139338,smartTv,"It's a let down, I purchased shinco based on internet review's. But it lacks lots of basic features. Cons. It does not support voice search. It does not support play store. It hangs when I play 4k content via YouTube, only way to restore is power cycle. It's display adjustment settings are poor. Brightness Not comfortable to eyes. (Cannot adjust display settings when in smart mode) Tried for refund within given 10 day timeline, but Amazon cheaters denied. Henceforth will keep away from Amazon. Guys do not waste your hard earned money on Amazon, buy via store/ showroom etc. First have look at its features yourself then only buy."

136610,mobile accessories,"I purchased this phone on the day of its sale, when there were no reviews available. I made a big mistake in trusting the brand ""Samsung"" blindly. This phone might have pros but they are nothing special. Many smaller brands also provide those features. The one particular flaw that annoyed me the most and made me write this harsh review is lack of notification LED light. This may sound simple but what it means if your phones battery is low you won't notice any warning. If you are charging your phone you don't know if its charging because there is no LED light. If you had a missed call no LED notification. If you had a text no notification. You will know all these only when you turn your screen on. So you turn your phone scree on regularly to check for all these. How the heck did they design a product like this. There are many annoying things in this phone but this one simple feature missing totally pissed me off. On top to rub salt on wounds...Amazon can't do refunds on phones which is a revelation to me. I jumped in and bought this phone in the first week and now I regret trusting Samsung. I already posted it on OLX, can't keep it. My suggestion is don't rush to buy it."

142528,smartTv,"Macintosh has come a long way since its inception back in 1984 and continues to delight us with its innovation mixed with futurist thinking. This 2017 version of MacBook is basically an â€˜old wine in a new bottleâ€™ getting a minimal increase of 0.2 GHz in processor speed over the 2015 version. Despite having negligible changes, MacBook Air 2017 remains the best choice for the Indian masses. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Why a MacBook Air? :::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Anyone trying to get their hands on this sleek beauty should definitely ask this question to themselves. Only after getting satisfactory answers, should they go forward to even â€˜thinkâ€™ of owning it. If you are into playing high graphics games, fancies in having terabytes of movies as a collection or gets pleasure in listening to loud music minus headphones, this device is definitely not for you to wish upon. However, if you are a frequent traveller, interested in neck-breathing performance coupled with really long battery life and is conscious of fashion etiquettes, this product is a must buy. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Positives :::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 1) Sleek and Ergonomic Design -- MacBook Air is a piece of silvery beast, ergonomically designed to appeal your senses, simultaneously making a fashion statement. 2) Quite Lightweight -- MacBook Air justifies its name, feels very light and hence much portable. 3) Excellent Backup -- Apple has definitely amazed me with the battery backup of the device which touches 11 hours on full charge. Additionally, if you leave it on sleep mode for a couple of days, it will hardly deplete even 2% each day. Donâ€™t believe me? Try it out! 4) Lightning Fast Booting -- The device boots itself in approximately 3 seconds and takes hardly 4 seconds to shut down. 5) Sugarcoated with Solid State Drive -- Since this device used Solid State Drive (SSD) as its storage medium; it is not only super fast but also extremely quiet. 6) Fast MagSafe Charger -- Well, the Air comes with MagSafe 2, a magnetic connector which attracts your charging inlet when taken near it. The charger charges the Air from 0 to 100 percent in less than 90 minutes, which is damn fast. 7) Noise Less Front Camera -- The camera it possesses is practically noise free and can impart exceptional picture even in low lighting conditions. 8) Ambient Light Sensors -- As all of you might have known, MacBook comes with keypad lightning, not to mention the backlit Apple logo. All of these are sensor enables and thus adjusts according to the lighting conditions. 9) Ample Key Spacing -- Apple packs a well designed keyboard in a 13.3 inch laptop giving ample amount of space between the keys and this is what I call an engineering marvel. 10) Mac OS -- The presence of Mac OS is solely enough to own a MacBook, taking into factor the OSâ€™s multi-level security, super stability, attractive GUI, virtually driver-less experience and its ability to recognise any Apple products. Additionally, having a personal assistant in name of Siri does not hurt anyone. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Negatives :::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 1) Screen Resolution -- Air is packed with LED backlit glossy display of resolution of 1440 x 900 pixels (HD Ready) with 128ppi. Not owning a laptop with at least a Full HD resolution in 2017 is surely a setback. 2) No Dedicated Graphics -- Nowadays, even basic games in the market requires a dedicated graphics and not having it clearly dismisses playing any game in this beastly device. 3) Lower Bass -- Although the device outputs good quality audio, there is a certain lack of bass being felt, which, in my opinion, could have been easily taken care of. After going through the pros and cons above, I am of the opinion that the decision making of yours will certainly be more definite. Also, be sure to look out for offers in Amazon as I got this device as low as 45K. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::: A Kind Request :::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Many of you have messaged me on Facebook asking either about the offer or about the device in details. I request anyone requiring any further help to kindly comment below this review or email me (found on my profile bio) as all your messages on facebook were in the 'Message Request' section and I did not get any notification for the same. If you are not comfortable publicly discussing, at least comment here saying 'Check your Facebook' or likewise so that I get aware of your willingness to reach me. Apologies to all who could not get my reply on time; it was unintentional."

I am writing this review after one year of use and yes itâ€™s water proof but after itâ€™s splashed with water itâ€™s speaker ðŸ”Š doesnâ€™t work you have to make sure that all the water ðŸš¿ has been removed or leave it for 30-40 min then only you can have clear sound all in all product is good but not at all value for money 10-15 k is added to its price for nothing
134813,smartTv,I got good one

114445,mobile,Awesome phone.... worth buying Battery is just superb
157536,mobile accessories,"The display of the mobile is obviously awesome because of s amoled and not to worry of battery life because of exynos 7904 which is made by Samsung only for battery consumption and also have the best 360 degree sound surround system and camera pro feature also I like it and both camera are of best of quality, face lock and fingerprint are also very best unlocked mobile within a sec."

136076,mobile,"I liked the over all performance of the mobile. But the phone gets heated if more apps are used at once. Also to mention it gets charged pretty quick... But also gets heated at the time of charging. I didn't have to charge the phone much often. Because, it didn't require that much charging thanks to its monster capacity battery life. The phone is bit heavy compared to my previous phone and is wide. It plays 1080p60 videos on YouTube. Had a good time Watching movies, series, and playing Pubg. Also it didn't consume that much of battery while playing games (Pubg). I would suggest people to buy 128GB, because the picture quality is good, and also shoots good slowmotion videos for which memory would be needed. Also, finger print sensor and face detection works best in this phone. It's has sAMOLED display which gives HD display. Pros: Good battery life Camera quality (reare as well as front) Good gaming experience Fingerprint reader Face reader sAMOLED display SAR is less than 0.5W/Kg Good Mobile look It Has Dolby Atmos so good speaker quality It Has screen mirroring Cons: Gets heated while charging Gets heated when more apps are open Heavy in weight"

134494,books,I can confirm you that there's no other book like this one. You might have seem books from arhihant etc but trust me this is all you will ever need (of course you've to read ncert books first). You can even supplement this with objective lucent (after reading subjective for revision purpose)) and necessary general science ( imo this is not really needed if you're studying for ssc or any state level exams except public service commission exams) . Conclusion: You can blindly go for this book. Lucent will take care of everything.

150847,mobile accessories,Phone was good as for performance wise lok wise. The only con was camera. I think it's not problem with camera. It's problem with there camera software.
157684,smartTv,"The item was defective, why should we pay for a brand new item and receive a defective product, on contacting Amazon customer service, they say it is under warranty and Apple service center will repair.

115306,mobile,Battar life
110616,smartTv,"A good buy for 14k Pros : 1. Screen quality is good - FHD. Useful for netflix, amazon prime and youtube. 2. Battery backup - Would last for 1.5 days on heavy usage. 3. Speakers - Dolby atmos ie fairly loud n clear. 4. Multi-tasking (without gaming) - Though its 2 gb ram, it seems faurly sufficient for daily usage. Cons: 1. Camera is pretty average - though cant expect more on a tablet. 2. Ram - With heavy gaming u feel this is a 2gb ram, with few lags. 3. Charging time is pretty slow. Takes a minimum of 2.5 hrs to charge. 4. Lack of fingerprint reader or face unlock. Overall, its a good buy for 14k when compared to ipad which is at about 21k for similar performance. If gaming is ur priority, this tab is not suggestible."
136626,refrigerator,"I purchased this product on 12th Feb 2019 and delivered and installed within 3 days. About the product it is value for money it 3 HDMI and 2 USB ports. I connect 2tb HDD and working fine, installed Jio tv able to watch all channels but issue with clarity. But other online content like YouTube am able to watch at 4k clarity. Go for it."
138501,mobile accessories,It is a very good product at it's price range but the camera quality could be more better. The battery life is no doubt work excellent. Yet while playing PUBG the mobile gets overheated & it lags when played at high resolution. Face detect & fingerprint work all fine but ram management is a little slower while opening multiple apps.
159095,mobile accessories,There's a search bar in settings and also suggestions are given to look for. The fingerprint sensor works really well even your fingers are wet. Amazing picture quality. Feels so real. Data savings are a saviour in today's world and SAMSUNG GALAXY J20 also gives you ultra data saving options too. You can also retrieve deleted photos within 15 days. And here comes the best part... My SAMSUNG GALAXY J20 can go almost 2 days without charging.!!
134823,refrigerator,I got it at a much much cheaper price than the prevailing market price. Now waiting for a favorable price for AF DX 35 mm lens.

132113,mobile,Great phone for all type of users. Back camera quality good but never adds detailing and front camera has little bit low. Battery backup is superb if you use playing and surfing net or watching youtube it will last 36 hrs u need charge after that. Finger print sensor is good fast working. No issue in playing pubg. But i didn't like sapphire blue colour so much so please buy other two colour go for black or white

All thanks to Amazon for delivering the phone in 2days, and I was awestruck after unpacking the phone. Honestly, the phone was much more fantastic than I expected and it was worth my money. The battery life is super awesome and the 6.4inch screen makes my Netflix time much enjoyable. Thank You Samsung and Amazon ðŸ˜Š"

118771,mobile,"CONS 1. I felt intermittent mild shock on back panel when I am using phone. 2. There are few MI inbuilt apps which we can neither uninstall nor avoid annoying their ads. They self update even after selecting the option ""Don't update"" in settings. 3. I've used MI Redmi 4 before whose battery was same as this, 4000mah. Comparing the discharge rate with my usage this discharges quick(even aft disabling face unlock). 4.Sometimes I don't get my downloaded photos and videos in gallery/file manager PROS 1. Rear camera is decent and less noises due to high quality sensors 2. This is one of the few phone which has less screen size with notch display(this is for those who like small screens) 3. Sound is loud and good. 4. Durable, as I slipped many times and fell on screen the display didn't break."

165463,mobile accessories,"Whereas Snapdragon 636 has 8Ã—Kryo 260 cores clocked at up to 1.8GHz. CPU of Exynos 7904 is seeming decent than that of Snapdragon 636. Kryo 260 cores are basically is a marketing term from Qualcomm. It means four Cortex A-73 based cores and four Cortex A-53 cores. With 4 high powered cores, Snapdragon 636 can outperform Exynos 7904 with only two Cortex A-73 Cores. I can bet Exynos 7904 cannot get a higher benchmark score than Snapdragon 636. You as a buyer can buy Snapdragon 636 powered smartphone without hesitation, If Samsung has also given 4 Cortex-A-73 cores then things might be changed. Heating of smartphones is a notorious/crucial issue with Samsung during gaming, its all depends on poor GPU-graphics. Exynos 7904 is trying to sort out this problem using a Mali-G71MP2 GPU graphics, which is new. However, Snapdragon 636 has an Adreno 509 GPU. We do not have a smartphone powered by this new Exynos chipset. PROCESSOR ONLY THE PRICE CHANGES. while buying the mobile check the processor speed. i learn from the mobile because i used before redmi note 3 this mobile faster then the Samsung galaxy m20. please dont buy this product"

143596,smartTv,"NOTE: This review is addressed to that class of people for whom Rs.60000-70000 smartphone is once in five years thing. Before you judge the rating which I have given and draw conclusions, I just want to let people who read this review realize that I am after technology with some innovation and out of the box concept as I never use a smartphone beyond 12 months. In this process, I literally used every high-end smartphone that was launched after iPhone 3G (my first hold of a smartphone), be it xperia, blackberry, samsung, nexus, HTC, what not! Now, coming to the point of fake ratings. I am a bit surprised to see so many negative reviews for an iPhone 7 on Amazon. KINDLY SEE FLIPKART, without the product even launched on their site, there are 864 ratings and as much as 4.9 stars out of 5 and not a single review (I am enclosing a pic for your reference). So, there is something which doesn't catch our eye. But these are the lame tricks that get played when you go neck to neck in competition, it applies to either side. ABOUT APPLE Undoubtedly, I give huge credit to Apple for introducing smartphone concept and in the process they slowly killed the once mighty Blackberry. Like Thomas Edison, credit goes to Apple for inventing such a masterpiece. But we are still not using the same bulb which Edison has invented. There are so many companies which are reinventing bulbs every year. Apple followed it up for few years with some changes in iPhone to keep the customer base solid. There is so much hype created over every Apple launch and in the process, the adversaries tried to copy the launch styles of Apple. So, they clearly have the margin. But, they are surely lagging behind in terms of innovation. This year iPhone 7 is one that's a perfect example. COMING TO THE PHONE Watched the launch event so closely, like I always do every year. I was using an iPhone 6 and was waiting for 7 (I have had an occasion to handle and experience both iPhone 7 and 7 plus even before they were launched in India). And finally ended up with Galaxy S7 Edge for a reason (BEFORE COMMENTING, RE-READ WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN IN THE FIRST TWO PARAGRAPHS OF MY REVIEW). I opted for S7 Edge for its curvy screen design with brilliant colours and the camera which beats the iPhone The dual camera on iPhone 7 plus is not new to the world before its launch. Secondly, they have their eyes set for the 10th Annniversary of iPhone in 2017 and are holding their cards till then. Both iOS and Android have their own pros and cons. This is the area which I am carefully and deliberately side lining and focusing on the phone. This year launch of iPhone 7 is only for those geeks, unlike me, who actually stick to iPhone for life and for whom the price tag is just a symbol to flaunt. Honestly, as most of the Apple users agree, what matters is the design of the phone. If i see a person standing about 5 feet away from me with an iPhone 7 (not plus) and me holding my iPhone 6, a third person will obviously think we are using the same phone (not talking about brand). So, if I were to shell Rs.60000 for a phone which retains the same design crafted with precision for three straight years, I better buy a device which satisfies me with its looks and performs as closely as an iPhone but loses the battle. And with Rs.20000 cheaper. I put my chips in there. Unless you have to run tasks which need some significant power like Games, it's not worth an upgrade or a first time buy.l I would request people to just think a bit before investing your hard earned money to go for iPhone 7. Join the line in which I am standing for the ""revolutionary"" design of an iPhone 8 in 2017. Because, that's when Apple is gonna show again to the world that they are masters of innovation. All the best!"

166028,mobile,"Worst camera. Leave about 48MP, after looking at the pics(in mobile, not PC/laptop) you will feel like pictures were taken from some kind of 2MP or age-old 8MP camera. The battery is good but not up to the mark, for 6000mah you would expect it to last for minimum 2 days at least with basic usage(no movies/games/heavy browsing etc..) like calls and checking notifications, messaging, etc. It lasted for just 28 hours for me with basic usage. Charging time was around 3hrs. Wifi coverage is also limited. It doesn't connect if I am in different room which was not the case with real me and One Plus phone. The only best thing is the display. I think this mobile has got the best display under 15K range. If your only priority is display then nothing can beat this mobile under 15K. And the worst part is that there is no replacement for this mobile, only refund. I believe replacement was not given considering the additional 1000 cashback which will be credited to the seller if they refund the amount, not sure though. Seller - STPL Exclusive Online."

154136,smartTv,"Shifted from android to iOS. I realise now.. Android was just a toy, a simulator. Actual joy of using a smartphone is actually only in iPhones. Beautiful, powerful and peaceful device (free from almost all chote chote issues which we generally compromise with androids). The phone actually â€˜helpsâ€™ us to manage it better. Example, it has an option, wether to use the volume buttons to reduce phone ring sounds or not. (Since sometimes while reducing volume of the video, we erroneously and unknowingly reduce the phone ringing sound.. and we miss some very important calls.. until we realise the mistake). It already has a physical silent button to use it when necessary without going through all the process of opening the phone- settings- shortcuts etc just to make the phone silent or vice versa. Battery although below 2000mah, performance is alike 3000 mah battery in androids. Use it and you can find the many many chote chote bate in it that makes your life easy and peaceful. And yes Interphase is very very simple without unnecessary clumsy designs but still â€˜very premium feelingâ€™ too. The click, the keyboard sound, the switch sound, the touch, the smoothness, the feel... all â€˜wowâ€™!!! Worth buying. Even at this cost, still a value for money/ value for peace!!!"

142814,mobile,MiA2 is a disaster! The company tried to make a stock android phone but guess their engineers were not equipped to do the job. The phones software is not compatibile with the hardware and this results in the below mentioned issues:- 1. Major lag issues on using different aps 2. Shuts down randomly and refuses to boot again 3. Occasionally hangs and becomes non responsive The company should ideally take back all the phone from the market and rework on it. I would have given a 0 rating to the phone but giving atleast 1 rating is a criteria.

142550,mobile,Main thing which i considered while burying this phone camara and battery. I had been using since 1 day. Camara is not actually look like 48mp texture of the photos look like old phone photos and it doesn't feel like pro camera i had compared with this phone to redmi note 5 pro which has far better than this camara. Battery was good but phone heats up on top of the portion i don't know why!! Coming to the privacy part there is no inbuilt app lock and notification hide feature which is a big drawback for me you can't hide notifications while you or someone using your phone if you really want to buy the phone for Camara it is better to not to buy this. on 15k you go for different options. Lastly overall experience with this phone is mixed one!

Cons: -10m bluetooth connectivity is a myth, it only supports upto 3-5 m. -wires are not quite durable or thick. -Bass is lower than average. -not durable for long run -ears starts to pain after a use of 30min. Pros: -gets charged quickly. -light weight -gets connected quickly,no problem in connection. So, for me this product is lower than average.Now it's up to you,so think twice before buying thus product."

133605,mobile accessories,"I am a genuine buyer of this phone and really astonished to see so many good reviews of this phone. I had to sell it one week later at a loss of 4k on cashify. Firstly I don't like that yellowish tint on screen which all Samsung phones have-- this one too has it. The camera quality is the real disappointment specially in indoor lights, they have failed to develop proper algo to interlace the pics from 3 cameras properly. Oppo and Vivo phones in same range offer 45 MP camera and have much better picture quality. Processor is also not satisfying, it's some old age one. Playing pubg with reduced graphics is the only option. Finger sensor is inferior to other same range phones... though it takes 1 sec to open the phone but practically 1sec is quite annoying. Others do it much faster. Amazon did not give any option to return it within 10 days and neither was I allowed to post any review earlier so posting it now after 2-3 months of it's launch. GOOD THINGS: Battery life is really great, it lasts for at least 2-3 days. Screen resolution and picture quality is very good. Lookwise it is a decent one."

132465,smartTv,Great sound for such a small box. Sound is crisp and clear. However donâ€™t expect it to match music system speakers.
157007,smartTv,"The audio cracks at 90%+ volume, + bass is kinda artificial.Buy only if its available at around 500. I brought it for 490/-"

118378,mobile,Bought it for my dad & it works pretty decent considering the fact that it's a xiaomi product. I'm usually pretty skeptical about such brands but it gets the job done I guess.
111466,mobile,After using for 15 days writing about my phone . Superb phone in <15000 . Having data on for full day battery is coming for 1.5days . Face recognition is so fast . Camara is great but photos are brighter than natural . Over all great phone in my budget .

149635,mobile,"Overall great phone and honestly it's a steal. I was a Samsung phone hater(mid-range segments) and preferred mi and realme but now the tables have turned. Based on my 10 days usage these are the things I noted(4GB variant):- 1)Great Battery Backup (lasts almost 2 days in normal usage and more than one day with heavy usage). 2)The sAmoled display and the touch response is great. 3)The speaker is decent and there is no problem in Calling which I felt bad in redmi devices but their 4g speed is greater than this phone(100 to 200 kbps difference only)not alarming maybe due to the snapdragon processor(which is better than exynos in power efficiency and performance). 4)The exynos 9611 is snappy,fast won't say power efficient because I think if they would have put snapdragon processor then the battery would have lasted for 3 days straight. Day to day usage and multi tasking is good may be due to lpddr4 ram and ufs 2.1 storage. 5)Camera qualty is ok. Trust me 48mp is just for marketing I can't see any difference in normal 12mp photos infact I liked 12 mp photos with hdr enabled and has more clarity than 48 mp. The dynamic range is good.u won't get the sharpness mainted after zooming the photos but kind of ok .wide angle camera also great but struggles in low light.Selfie camera is average and struggles in low light I felt decent only there is not much detailing that u could see in other devices like mi and realme in this segment. Infact I think it's ok because it's main sensor and selfie sensor is wider than the camera's used in other phones therefore there is a little blur at the sides of the focus point when u zoom the photos. The camera app has many features like slo-mo,I personally liked the ar face feature, night mode is crap. Video recording is very good with eis,sound recording is also good. Overall the camera is ok but if u want the best camera then go for apple ,oneplus and gcam fully enabled phones. 6)The samsung One UI is I perfect,elegant and snappy to use I used lean launcher to look more beautiful. 7)Design is good and in hand feel is also excellent. 8)Built quality is low because it dosen't have a gorilla glass protection and the back cover is very light that when I pressed the sides a clicking sound is produced but it's ok.I would highly recommend a screen protector and back case. 9)while keeping the camera app open the phone gets heated up a little and gets heated on the top portion of the phone.But it was suprising to see that the phone cools down very fast. After reading all this if ur still confused to buy this phone then wait till 2100ðŸ˜ to buy the best phone at budget price."

141059,mobile accessories,"Jio Internet speed too low(i think, its s/w problem)... Price could be less..... No dual volte 4g(only one sim 4g volte at a time).... Hybrid sim.. Battery life is very good... Sound quality is clear and average... Rear Camera is best... Selfie camera is average.. (Overall best phone)... You can buy other phone like asus,realme...in this 10k segment(if u not happy)...."

119591,mobile,Camera-Its one of the best camera I have ever seen specially its wide angle is excellent and camera clarity is the best. Finger Print reader- It miss out sometimes when your hands are bit wet so make sure to make your hands dry before you scan it. Battery life- its excellent it gives me a two days of battery life with excessive usage .

163706,smartTv,"Very good speaker for its size. Bass is on the lower size but the sound clarity is good. Sound starts to crack above 80%, i prefer to play at mid volume which is good for a small room battery life is also surprisingly good. I played music 30-45 mins everyday and it lasted me an entire week for a single charge. I got it for 1399, satisfied with the product."
162823,mobile,Very good
147502,mobile,Not good. Waste of money. Small blots in screen
120141,books,"Curious about the buzz this book has generated, I picked it up, prepared to be inspired. I wasn't. It's a nice little fable -- one that you could even read to your kids -- but I didn't find in it any wisdom for the ages. Here's the basic message: ""Trust your intuition. Follow your dreams."" Heard it before? Yeah, I thought so. There really aren't any deep thoughts in the The Alchemist. It's basically a kind of New Age fairy tale. It exhorts you to think big but doesn't really make you think too much. Some have compared it to Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet. Not even close. That thin volume makes you stop every few sentences to ponder its wisdom. It's not much of a story but it's definitely deep. The Alchemist is exactly the opposite: an endearing little story but no great strain on the intellect. Maybe it will cheer you up. Maybe it will give you the encouragement you need to chase your dream. If so, you probably didn't need much of a boost in the first place."

113017,mobile,As a mid usage user I strongly suggest this if camera is not a first preference for you. I am totally satisfied with this mobile every aspects except the camera in low light and in most of the conditions if I need to zoom. Camera output will be too poor if you zoom while capturing photos
