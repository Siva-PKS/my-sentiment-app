134236,mobile,"I bought the phone on Amazon and been using my Samsung M30s for couple of weeks now. Delivery experience from Amazon - top notch. The best thing about the phone is its battery life. With normal usage, the battery works for days. With lots of gaming and app usage, it still easily works for 2 days. With 6000 mAH battery life is no problem at all. The 6.4"" super AMOLED display is awesome. The camera notch at top is minimum. Gives a very immersive experience while gaming or watching videos. With 8 core CPU, performance of gaming and other heavy apps is extremely good. The back camera is 48MP triple rear camera. What that means is you can snap photos normally and ultra-wide shots. The night mode is also good. Front camera is also good. No auto-focus for front camera. Optical image stabilisation is missing for both cameras. All in all, the camera is great in the price range. The pricing of the phone makes it a great buy. The build quality is similar to other Samsung phones. Very light weight and sleek phone. Only disadvantage I found is the speakers of this phone. No stereo support and the only speaker at the bottom is very low in volume. Verdict - With the given price range, the battery life, great camera and amazing display makes this phone a great buy !!",9-Oct-24,spkincident@gmail.com

157661,smartTv,"The iPhone 7 is legitimately among the most interesting, opinionated, powerful phones Apple has ever shipped, and the most confident expressions of the company's vision in a long time. New iOS 11 is excellent, the camera is much better, and the performance is phenomenal (stay away from Android users who say I have 4 - 6 - 8 - or - 100 GB of RAM, iPhone beats everyone in limited resources). Good Stuff - Water resistance - Improved cameras - Better battery life - Great display - Taptic engine feedback is neat Bad Stuff * Trust me these are advanced features that we are not used to if you are then these are Good stuff. - Lack of headphone jack is inconvenient - Wireless audio ecosystem is immature",26-Feb-25,spkincident@gmail.com

118439,smartTv,"Bought this at a great price during the prime day sale. Had the previous gen full hd fire stick which served me well on my previous smart TV. Bought this to check out the improvements and also to compare it with the native apps on WebOS on my TV. This literally blows away the native apps. Dolby vision, hdr10 works flawlessly. I had my doubts about the wifi since I'm pretty old school and always hardwire stuff. But the AC wifi on this works even better than the wired ethernet connection on my TV. The apps run great and super fast. Lastly and this is my opinion a huge huge win.. Plex. This stick actually plays 4K in plex without transcoding with absolutely no issues. That just sealed the deal for me. Granted you need a pretty beefy pc to do this and mine is, but even then the WebOS plex app used to glitch out every now and then. Tip : Keep the hdr on the stick to adaptive and tweak the dolby vision and hdr settings on your TV separately. Once you nail them right, there's no going back to native apps.

( C+) - selfie camera under good lighting situations produces decent photos , struggle at low light. -Video stabilization is A+ just awesome - auto focus in video is a hit or miss - you can even play PUBG at high graphics with minimal frame drops , gaming also good If you want A+ display A+ battery life and low light camera is on your low priority then this is the phone for you.

The fingerprint scanner and the face detection is also quite impressive in this segment, the response time is less than a second. There is no lag while playing games ,the screen quality is very good. The light sensor is very responsive also the camera quality is nice and given that the wide camera lens makes it much more interesting. Talking about the front camera it is also impressive as compared to the price tag of the phone . It also has fast charging and charges it at a rate of 1 to 2 percent per minute or slight less than a minute. The body is scratch less and the it comes with a single speaker but it is more than enough. The touch is very smooth and feathery. There are many additional features like increase touch sensitivity while using gloves and device manager. And nonetheless it comes with a brand value of Samsung providing nice service all around the globe and easy to locate the service centers anywhere in India or in any other country. So my recommendation is to go for it because in this range the Samsung has offered everything to make it a premium flagship .",22-Oct-24,spkincident@gmail.com

159953,mobile,This is the best mobile provided by realme at this price range. The design and look of the phone is very good. The phone works excellent and battery life is superb. The charging speed of the phone is also good. The rear camera of the phone is also fine but the portrait mode of the phone is not that ok. It sometimes blur the edge of the object and the sharpness of the picture is not that great in the portrait mode. Although front camera is very good and takes very good selfies. At last the phone is very good choice at this price range and it is value for the money product.,3-Apr-25,spkincident@gmail.com

And I was not disappointed. Though I don't have any fascination on Mobile camera, Still like to say that it is awesome. I feel no one can beat Samsung on this part, except iPhone.

134050,mobile,I am writing this review after using it for more than one week. At this price point this phone is amazing. I should say battery is really a monster. Let me explain individual points : Display : It's super amoled. So no doubt display is 5/5. Camera : we have triple camera setup here. 48 mp gives good detail and wide angle lens also gives a good coverage. Performance of depth camera is also good. Front camera is performing good when u have good lighting. In low lighting if you are taking individual selfies then you have option of display flash and that gives a good. Performance : this mobile is performing really good in day to day usage. UI : less customization available. But easy to use that is good. Battery : that is a real MONSTER. I love small mobiles so it could have been a complete killer for me if screen size is less than 6 inches.,11-Dec-24,spkincident@gmail.com

153528,mobile accessories,"Right decision taken by Samsung to reduce the price by 1000â‚¹ within 15 days of its launched. Those who (including me) have purchased it with its original price feels cheated. But I still believe with its current price 7999 the phone is not worth as you can get much better options. So I will not be surprised if it makes another price cut within next 15 days. Now abt the phone , I only find the battery and the super amoled screen good, Rest the camera , cpu performance and signal strength not good. Finger print sensor is slow. For comparison the Redmi 7 gives better performance than this phone. I am sure with this price bracket there are much better options available in amazon itself.",9-Jul-24,spkincident@gmail.com

I think I don't need to review an iPhone! It is out of the world, no doubt about that, but I am here surprised because I actually got an email, asking me to give 1 star rating to iPhone7 on amazon.in, and in return, they'll send me some freebies! This is both terrible and concerning. Looking at the reviews now, it is quite evident that people in India are obviously believing this. EVERY 1/2/3 star review is fake, and it is really easy to spot one. - NONE of them have 'Verified Purchase' badge, infact as of now, I am the only one with this badge! - Most accounts were created on the same date to get the freebies. - Most have only 1 item review history. I hope they all are getting their free USB data cable. - There are bots that can create these fake amazon accounts with disposable email ID's.

Not a game addict hance cant comment on that but gives a professional look &good for business use. Camers quality is good as well. Initially faced some network issue but later it turned out to be problem of Idea. It sucks. Switched tk Airtel &the phone is skyrocketing the internet speed &clarity of calls. Cant ask more than this at the price being offered. Kudos Samsung!",17-Feb-25,spkincident@gmail.com
